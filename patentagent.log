A digital transmitter comprising an equalizer which generates output signal levels, the equalizer comprising:  parallel digital filter circuits operating on different multiple bit portions of a multiple bit input;  and  a multiplexing circuit which multiplexes outputs of the parallel digital filter circuits to provide a combined equalized output at a rate greater than the rate from each digital filter circuit, the equalizer driving full current in opposite directions on both sides of a transition and driving an attenuated current when a signal value remains unchanged. "}, 41=>{:num=>41, :parent=>41, :claim=>"41.  A digital transmitter comprising an equalizer which emphasizes transition signal levels relative to repeated signal levels, the equalizer converting an input baseband signal with a bandwidth of at least 100 MHz at an input data rate to an output signal having a greater number of discrete signal levels at the input data rate, equalization being based on time since last signal transition, the equalizer generating signal levels by multiplexing outputs of parallel logic circuits operating on different multiple bit inputs, the equalizer driving full current in opposite directions on both sides of a transition and driving an attenuated current when a signal value remains unchanged."}}
