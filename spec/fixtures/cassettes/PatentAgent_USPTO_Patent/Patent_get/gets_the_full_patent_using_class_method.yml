        sensor for sensing acceleration acting on the vehicle is\nmounted to a rim
        of the steering wheel, and the steering wheel rim has at least one electrical
        outer conductor and at least one electrical inner conductor for forming a
        coaxial arrangement.\n<BR><BR> 2.  The sensor system as claimed in claim 1,
        characterized in that the acceleration sensor senses the field effect, the
        force effect and/or the resulting deformation of part of the steering wheel
        relative to the at least one outer conductor\nand/or to the at least one inner
        conductor.\n<BR><BR> 3.  The sensor system as claimed in claim 1, characterized
        in that the acceleration sensor senses a distance between two parts of the

        application filed under 35 U.S.C.  .sctn.371 of International Application
        PCT/EP2007/055511, filed on Jun.  5, 2007, designating the United States,
        which claims priority from DE 10 2006 031 207.4, filed\nJul.  3, 2006, which
        are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n<BR><BR>FIELD
        OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR> The invention relates to a sensor system for a
        steering wheel and to a steering wheel.\n<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR>
        In vehicle engineering there is a constant need to improve the active and
        passive safety of a motor vehicle.  In order to improve both the active and
        passive safety it is necessary for travel data of the motor vehicle to be
        acquired and further\nprocessed quickly and reliably.  This is the only way
        that safety-related devices for active safety (for example ABS systems) or
        for passive safety (for example airbags) can be actuated.\n<BR><BR> These
        systems can operate reliably only if relevant data is acquired efficiently
        by means of sensors.  For example, in the event of an impact an impulse is
        applied to the motor vehicle in a very short time.\n<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE
        INVENTION\n<BR><BR> The present invention is based on the object of providing
        a device with which it is possible to react, in particular, to impact events
        quickly and efficiently.\n<BR><BR> The object is achieved by virtue of the
        fact that at least one sensor means for sensing the effect of an acceleration
        is arranged in and/or on a steering wheel rim.\n<BR><BR> It is particularly
        advantageous if the steering wheel rim has at least one electrical outer conductor
        and at least one electrical inner conductor for forming a coaxial arrangement.
        \ As a result, module-integral components can be used within the\nscope of
        the sensor means.\n<BR><BR> In addition it is advantageous if the sensor means
        senses the field effect, the force effect and/or the resulting deformation
        of part of the steering wheel relative to the at least one outer conductor
        and/or to the at least one inner conductor. \nThese variables can be sensed
        satisfactorily and constitute a measure of the acceleration or its effect.
        \ An effect is, for example, an oscillation which propagates in the steering
        wheel as far as the steering wheel rim.\n<BR><BR> A simple design is obtained
        if the sensor means senses the distance between two parts of the steering
        wheel rim.\n<BR><BR> An advantageous measurement principle is obtained if
        the at least one sensor means has a capacitive and/or an inductive sensor
        unit or is coupled to a capacitive and/or inductive sensor unit.  In conjunction
        with a coaxial arrangement it is\nadvantageous if the capacitive and/or inductive
        sensor unit is coupled to parts of the steering wheel, in particular the at
        least one outer conductor and at least one inner conductor with different
        masses, rigidity and/or densities so that a signal for\nsensing the acceleration
        can be generated from the deformation of the parts.\n<BR><BR> An advantageous
        embodiment of the sensor system has a transmitting means, in particular at
        least one antenna loop for emitting a coaxial wave, a TE wave, a TM wave,
        a TEM wave and/or a wave, and a sensor means for detecting a reflection of
        the\ncoaxial wave, of the TE wave, of the TM wave, of the TEM wave and/or
        of the wave.  It is particularly advantageous here if at least two conductor
        loops are arranged in the steering wheel rim.  If four conductor loops are
        advantageously arranged\nsymmetrically in the steering wheel rim, in particular
        each in a quadrant, direction sensing is possible in a particularly efficient
        way.  It is also advantageous if at least one antenna loop and/or at least
        one conductor loop can be used for\ndirection-indicating detection of a force
        effect.\n<BR><BR> Furthermore it is advantageous if the receiver means senses
        a change in a property of the coaxial wave, in particular a field line change
        and/or attenuation as a function of a relative movement of parts of the steering
        wheel.  The receiver means\nadvantageously senses the reflection factor.\n<BR><BR>
        A particularly simple design is obtained if the skeleton of the steering wheel
        rim is embodied at least partially as an inner conductor.  A further advantageous
        embodiment is that a steering wheel heating device is embodied in the steering
        wheel\nrim, at least partially as an outer conductor.\n<BR><BR> The change
        in signals in the interior of the steering wheel rim can be influenced by
        arranging at least one dielectric element in the steering wheel rim.  It is
        particularly advantageous if the dielectric element is arranged as a foamed
        material\njacket and/or liquid container in the steering wheel rim.\n<BR><BR>
        The steering wheel rim is advantageously electrically insulated with respect
        to the steering wheel plate.\n<BR><BR> According to the invention, the influence
        of an acceleration can be sensed, and in this context it is advantageous if
        a triggering means for an airbag fires the airbag as a function of a triggering
        signal which is generated by the sensor means.\n<BR><BR> So that the sensor
        means does not respond when customary accelerations occur in the motor vehicle,
        it is advantageous that the triggering signal is not output by the sensor
        means until the effect of the acceleration exceeds a predetermined\nvalue.\n<BR><BR>
        The object is also achieved by means of a steering wheel having a sensor system
        according to the invention. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n<BR><BR>

        FIG. 6 is a schematic illustration of the decoupling of the steering wheel

        of a steering wheel with four integrated conductor loops.\n<BR><BR>DETAILED
        DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n<BR><BR> In the event of an impact
        a negative acceleration acts via a force effect to bring about different deformations
        of the bodywork of the motor vehicle and parts of the motor vehicle.  The
        acceleration and its force effect depend here on the mass\nof the respective
        part of the motor vehicle, i.e. when there is an identical force effect, relatively
        lightweight parts of the motor vehicle are accelerated less than relatively
        heavy parts of the motor vehicle.  The acceleration can also be manifest in\nthe
        form of an oscillation.\n<BR><BR> In the text which follows, different embodiments
        of a sensor system according to the invention are presented, in each of which
        embodiments a sensor means 1, with which the acceleration B acting on the
        vehicle can be sensed quickly and\nefficiently, is provided.\n<BR><BR> In
        this context, in the first three embodiments the sensor means 1 is coupled
        to a coaxial arrangement having an outer conductor 1A and an inner conductor
        1B.  The input signals 4 of the sensor means 1 are generated by means of electrical\ninteractions
        between the outer conductor 1A and the inner conductor 1B, with the interactions
        resulting from the acceleration effects acting on the steering wheel or parts
        thereof.\n<BR><BR> The first group of embodiments relates to changes in the
        capacitance C and/or the inductance L in the steering wheel rim 10 which are
        converted into output signals 5 by the sensor means 1.  The output signals
        5 are used to address other parts of\nthe motor vehicle or trigger them.  An
        output signal 5 can therefore be used to trigger an airbag (not illustrated)
        in the steering wheel if a predetermined value for the acceleration B is reached).\n<BR><BR>
        In addition, the sensor means 1 has an inductive sensor unit 2 and/or a capacitive
        sensor unit 3.\n<BR><BR> The changes in the capacitance and/or the inductances
        are brought about by changes in the distances between parts of the steering
        wheel rim 10, specifically the outer conductor 1A and the inner conductor
        1B.  The changes in distance can be\nattributed to different accelerations
        (for example force effects) within the steering wheel rim 10.\n<BR><BR> FIG.
        1 illustrates a first embodiment in which the capacitance is used as a measurement
        variable.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 1 illustrates a section through a steering wheel
        rim 10 which has the following design from the inside to the outside.  The
        skeleton of the steering wheel rim 10, which forms the electrically conductive
        inner conductor 1A of a coaxial\narrangement here is arranged in the interior.
        \ The skeleton 1A is surrounded by a foamed layer, which is embodied here
        as a dielectric element 30.\n<BR><BR> The foamed layer 30 is surrounded by
        two shielding means in this embodiment.  A heating web 1B on the circumference
        of the steering wheel rim 10 forms the outer conductor 1B of the coaxial arrangement.
        \ In addition, but not absolutely\nnecessarily, a further shielding layer
        31 is arranged inside the outer conductor 1A.  Basically, a plurality of heating
        webs can also be used.\n<BR><BR> On the outside, the steering wheel rim is
        surrounded by a sheath 32 which can be composed of wood, leather or plastic.\n<BR><BR>
        The coaxial arrangement with an inner conductor 1B and outer conductor 1A
        is to be conceived of in a first approximation as a coaxial cable whose capacitance
        C is given by\n<BR><BR> .times..pi..times..times..times.  ##EQU00001##\n<BR><BR>
        Here l is the length of the coaxial arrangement (for example the length of
        the steering wheel rim 10, r.sub.I is the radius of the inner conductor 1B
        and r.sub.A is the radius of the outer conductor 1A.  In the embodiment according
        to FIG. 1,\nthe steering wheel skeleton 1B does not have a circular cross
        section so that this equation applies only approximately.\n<BR><BR> As a result
        of an acceleration B which acts on the steering wheel rim 10, the geometric
        relationships in the steering wheel rim 10 change.  As a result of a compression
        of the dielectric element 30, i.e. the foamed layer, the distance between\nthe
        inner conductor 1B and the outer conductor 1A changes, which can be measured
        as a change in capacitance according to the above equation.  If the distance
        between the outer conductor 1A and the inner conductor 1B decreases (given
        a constant diameter\nof the inner conductor 1B), the capacitance drops.\n<BR><BR>
        In a second embodiment according to FIG. 2, the basic design of the first
        embodiment is adopted so that reference can be made to the corresponding explanations.\n<BR><BR>
        However, the dielectric element 30 is divided into two layers 30A, 30B here.
        \ The foamed component in the first layer 30A has here a different density
        or a different compression module from the foamed component in the second
        layer 30B.  A\ndifference in the compression module indicates the degree to
        which the foam can be compressed under loading.\n<BR><BR> The two embodiments
        according to FIGS. 1 and 2 have been described in relation to a capacitive
        measurement method.\n<BR><BR> Alternatively or additionally it is also possible
        to apply an inductive measurement method.  The acceleration or force effect
        on the steering wheel rim and its parts also brings about a change in the
        inductance L.\n<BR><BR> In the case of a coaxial cable arrangement, which
        can be approximately assumed, the inductance is given as\n<BR><BR> .mu..times..mu..times..times..pi..times..times.
        \ ##EQU00002##\n<BR><BR> If the distance r.sub.A between the outer conductor
        1A and inner conductor 1B decreases, the inductance drops.\n<BR><BR> The embodiments
        according to FIGS. 1 and 2 have been illustrated here independently of the
        frequency.  The embodiments can, however, readily also have a frequency-dependent
        evaluation so that amplitude signals and/or phase signals can be\nevaluated.\n<BR><BR>
        A third embodiment of the sensor system according to the invention is also
        based on a coaxial arrangement, but the effect of an acceleration is determined
        in a different way.\n<BR><BR> Here, the same coaxial basis configuration as
        that described in FIG. 1 or 2 is assumed.  Here, the influence of the field
        lines of a coaxial wave and/or a wave which is located in the steering wheel
        rim 10 is used as the measurement variable. \nHere, the dielectric constant
        of the dielectric 30 (for example foamed material) is responsible for the
        propagation of the coaxial wave.\n<BR><BR> In the text which follows, the
        basic principles of this embodiment are presented in relation to a steering
        wheel rim, with reference being made to FIGS. 3A and 3B.  FIG. 3A shows a
        cross section through a coaxial arrangement, and FIG. 3B shows a\nlongitudinal
        section.  The curvature of the steering wheel rim is ignored in FIGS. 3A and
        3B.\n<BR><BR> The electrical field lines of the coaxial wave (TEM wave) in
        which no field strength components occur in the direction of the line axis
        (perpendicular to the plane of the drawing in FIG. 3A) run radially in the
        cross-sectional plane.  The\ncharacter of the field is also determined by
        the equipotential lines 40 (annular) shown as a dashed line in FIG. 3A.  Between
        two adjacent lines 40 of equal potential the same voltage difference .DELTA.U=U/m
        is present if U is the total voltage between\nthe conductors 1A, 1B and m
        is the number of strips of equal potential difference.  In FIG. 3A, m=3 since
        three concentric rings are assumed.\n<BR><BR> In contrast, the field lines
        divide the cross section into n strips 41 of equal capacitance and in FIG.
        3A n=16.  The capacitance C.sub.S of such a strip 41 of equal capacitance
        results from the series connection of the elementary capacitances\nC.sub.E
        (box), C.sub.S=C.sub.E/m which are formed by the lines of equal potential
        and bounded by the field lines.\n<BR><BR> The line capacitance per cm line
        length, referred to as capacitance per unit length C', can then be determined
        by a parallel connection of the in n=16 equal capacitances C.sub.S, that is
        to say from the sum\n<BR><BR> '.times..times.  ##EQU00003##\n<BR><BR> As a
        numerical value equation in pF/cm:\n<BR><BR> '.times..times.  ##EQU00004##\n<BR><BR>
        The inductance of the line per centimeter line length, referred to as the
        inductance per unit length L', can also be obtained from the field form.  For
        a homogeneous dielectric with permeability .mu..sub.r the following applies:\n<BR><BR>
        '.mu..times..mu..times.  ##EQU00005## or in numbers (nH/cm)\n<BR><BR> '.times..pi..times..times..mu..times.
        \ ##EQU00006##\n<BR><BR> The characteristic impedance Z (in Ohms) is the quotient
        of the voltage and current of the progressive coaxial wave measured at any
        point on a loss-free high-frequency line.  It is real for loss-free lines
        and therefore:\n<BR><BR> ''.times..mu..times..mu.  ##EQU00007## .times..times..mu..times..times.

        In the above equation, rn signifies the number of dielectrics or permeabilities.\n<BR><BR>
        Since the characteristic impedance therefore constitutes a constant value
        for the total coaxial value for the total line path, it can also be given
        as a function of the internal diameter D of the outer diameter 1A and of the
        external diameter of\nthe inner conductor 1B:\n<BR><BR> .times..times.  ##EQU00008##
        where .di-elect cons..sub.r is the relative dielectric constant of the dielectric
        between the inner conductor 1A, and outer conductor 1B.\n<BR><BR> The determining
        characteristic variable for a coaxial connection is therefore the characteristic
        impedance Z.\n<BR><BR> From the above relationship for the characteristic
        impedance Z it becomes clear that a change in the diameter has an influence
        on the characteristic impedance Z which can be detected.  This is described
        in more detail below.  If, for example,\nthe diameter D is smaller, the characteristic
        impedance Z also drops.\n<BR><BR> Attenuation and Skin Effect\n<BR><BR> The
        sum of the following loss components produces the attenuation of electromagnetic
        waves on the coaxial line:\n<BR><BR> .alpha..sub.1 resistive attenuation of
        the inner conductor 1B\n<BR><BR> .alpha..sub.A resistive attenuation of the
        outer conductor 1A\n<BR><BR> .alpha..sub.G leakage attenuation\n<BR><BR> For
        the attenuation .alpha.  the following applies generally .alpha.=.alpha..sub.R+.alpha..sub.G.
        \ Here, .alpha..sub.L=.alpha..sub.i+.alpha..sub.a the absolute value of what
        is referred to as the longitudinal attenuation.\n<BR><BR> The resistive attenuation
        values are decisively influenced by the skin effect which is effective at
        high frequencies.\n<BR><BR> For the calculation of the loss values it is necessary
        that the currents only flow in a uniformly distributed fashion in what is
        referred to as an equivalent conductive layer thickness.  In the case of nonmagnetic
        materials--where\n.mu..sub.r=1--the conduction layer thickness s is obtained
        as a numerical value equation (cm; Hz):\n<BR><BR> .times.  ##EQU00009##\n<BR><BR>
        The correction factor k.sub.1 is dependent on the conductor material used
        and is, for example, standardized for silver k.sub.1=1.0 and for gold k.sub.1=1.17.
        \ In addition, the specific surface resistivity Q' is defined as the resistance
        of a\npiece of the surface of the thickness s with the length 1 cm and the
        width 1 cm.  Therefore, for .mu..sub.r=1 and with the conductivity N(s/M)

        .alpha..sub.R of the inner conductor .alpha..sub.i and of the outer conductor
        .alpha..sub.a are essentially dependent on {square root over (f)}, and on
        the conductivity and thickness of the\nconductive layer which act in an inversely
        proportional fashion.\n<BR><BR> Given the same conductor materials, for .alpha..sub.R=.alpha..sub.i+.alpha..sub.a
        the following applies\n<BR><BR> .alpha..times..times..times..pi..times..times..times.''

        current paths are longer and the equivalent resistances and losses are greater
        than in the case of conductors with smooth surfaces.  Contact points should
        therefore have short current paths.\n<BR><BR> The effect of the dielectric
        losses in the conductance per unit length G' is generally described by means
        of the expression .alpha..sub.G=.pi.f {square root over (L'C' tan .delta..di-elect
        cons.)}\n<BR><BR> The conductance losses grow proportionally with f if .delta..di-elect
        cons.  is approximately independent of the frequency.\n<BR><BR> Reflection
        Factor\n<BR><BR> As a determining value for the quality of a coaxial connection,
        the reflection factor r which is related to the nominal value of the characteristic
        impedance Z.sub.L is defined as:\n<BR><BR> ##EQU00012## with Z as the measured
        characteristic impedance at the respective location of the line and Z.sub.L
        is the characteristic impedance on the line (nominal value).\n<BR><BR> Likewise,
        the reflection factor can be determined by acquiring the voltage distribution
        along a measuring line:\n<BR><BR> ##EQU00013##\n<BR><BR> Measuring methods
        for this are defined by DIN 47275 part 3.  In this context, the variables
        of the ripple factor\n<BR><BR> ##EQU00014## and adaptation factor\n<BR><BR>
        ##EQU00015## are defined.  The smaller the reflection factor at a frequency
        the better the coaxial connection system.\n<BR><BR> Further embodiments make
        use of these relationships by sensing changes in the field lines or changes
        in the attenuation of the coaxial wave as a function of the effect of the
        acceleration.\n<BR><BR> In the steering wheel rim 10, the dielectric 30, 30A,
        30B influences the propagation of the coaxial wave.\n<BR><BR> A third embodiment
        which utilizes these effects is illustrated in FIG. 4.  The basic design of
        the skeleton 1B as an inner conductor, an outer conductor 1B and the first
        dielectric element 30A correspond to the subject matter of FIGS. 1 and 2.\n<BR><BR>
        In a third embodiment according to FIG. 4, cavities 33 which are filled with
        liquid are arranged as the dielectric element 30A in the foamed material layer.
        \ Alternatively, liquid hoses can also be included.\n<BR><BR> In the event
        of an impact, the filled cavities 33 in the steering wheel rim experience
        a force effect owing to the acceleration.  The dielectric properties in the
        steering wheel rim 10 therefore change, which in turn leads to a detectable
        change\nin the wave propagation; signals are changed or delayed.\n<BR><BR>
        These changes in the signals can additionally or alternatively be used for
        the signals which result from deformations owing to the capacitive or inductive
        signals.\n<BR><BR> These changes in the signals can also additionally be used
        for the changes in the characteristic resistance due to changes in the geometry.\n<BR><BR>
        FIG. 5 is a schematic illustration of a fourth embodiment in which, for example,
        an antenna loop 36 is arranged in the interior of the steering wheel 10 in
        addition to the skeleton, it being possible to couple said antenna loop 36
        to the\nskeleton 1B.  This antenna emits a wave, and in the event of a crash
        the wave properties of the field lines of the emitted field change.  These
        changes (frequency dependent or non-frequency dependent) can be detected in
        a direction-indicating fashion as\neffects of accelerations and can be used
        within the scope of a crash sensor.  This embodiment therefore does not emerge
        directly from a coaxial arrangement.\n<BR><BR> All the illustrated embodiments
        have in common the fact that it is possible to define a threshold value below
        which the sensor system does not output a crash signal.  Therefore, the steering
        wheel can be deformed through normal loading when\ndriving, in which case
        the deformation variable and/or the deformation speed are clearly differentiated
        from those in impact events.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 6 illustrates how a means of electrically
        isolating the steering wheel rim 10 from the plate 11 can be embodied.  In
        this context, an electrically nonconductive section, which insulates the plate
        11 electrically from the steering wheel, is\nintroduced into a spoke 35 of
        the steering wheel.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 7 illustrates an embodiment in which four
        conductor loops 36a, 36b, 36c, 36d are arranged in the steering wheel rim
        10.  The conductor loops 36a, 36b, 36c, 36d are each arranged in the four
        quadrants.  When the steering wheel moves it is\npossible to detect the position
        of the respective conductor loops 36a, 36b, 36c, 36d so that, for example,
        information about the type of crash event (head-on crash, side crash, roll
        over etc.) can also be derived from this position information.\n<BR><BR> The
        invention is not restricted in its embodiment to the preferred exemplary embodiments
        specified above.  Instead, a number of variants are conceivable which also
        make use of the sensor system according to the invention in embodiments which
        are\nbasically of a different nature.\n<BR><BR><CENTER><B>* * * * *</B></CENTER>\n<HR>\n
