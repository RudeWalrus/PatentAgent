        \        <BR><CENTER><B>Abstract</B></CENTER>\n         <P>An equalizer provided
        in a digital transmitter compensates for attenuation\n     in a signal channel
        to a digital receiver. The equalizer generates signal\n     levels as a logical
        function of bit history to emphasize transition signal\n     levels relative
        to repeated signal levels. The preferred equalizer\n     includes an FIR transition
        filter using a look-up table. Parallel circuits\n     including FIR filters
        and digital-to-analog converters provide a high\n     speed equalizer with
        lower speed circuitry. The equalizer is particularly\n     suited to in-cabinet
        and local area network transmissions where feedback\n     circuitry facilitates
        adaptive training of the equalizer.\n</P>\n         <HR>\n<TABLE WIDTH=\"100%\">

        OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR>The performance of many digital systems is limited
        by the interconnection bandwidth between chips, boards, and cabinets.  As
        VLSI technology continues to scale, system bandwidth will become an even more
        significant bottleneck as the number of\nI/Os scales more slowly than the
        bandwidth demands of on-chip logic.  Also, off-chip signalling rates have
        historically scaled more slowly than on-chip clock rates.  Most digital systems
        today use full-swing unterminated signalling methods that are\nunsuited for
        data rates over 100 MHz on one meter wires.  Even good current-mode signalling
        methods with matched terminations and carefully controlled line and connector
        impedance are limited to about 1 GHz by the frequency-dependent attenuation
        of\ncopper lines.  Without new approaches to high-speed signalling, bandwidth
        will stop scaling with technology when we reach these limits.\n<BR><BR>SUMMARY
        OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR>Conventional approaches to dealing with frequency
        dependent attenuation on transmission lines have been based on equalization,
        either in the transmitter or the receiver.  For example, Tomlinson preceding
        is used in modems, and digital\nequalization in binary communication channels
        has been suggested in U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,374,426 to Burlage et al. However,
        such systems cannot scale to very high data rate binary or multilevel systems
        having bandwidths extending from near DC to greater\nthan 100 MHz.  Above
        100 MHz, there is substantial attenuation due to skin effect resistance on
        conventional transmission lines.\n<BR><BR>The present invention enables equalizers
        which can be implemented as digital filters operating at acceptable clock
        speeds.  For example, a three gigabit per second (Gbps) system can be implemented
        using 400 Mbps circuitry.  The invention has\nparticular application to nonmodulated,
        high data rate, binary or multilevel systems as found locally within a data
        processor cabinet or on a local area network.\n<BR><BR>In accordance with
        the present invention, a digital transmitter comprises an equalizer which
        emphasizes transition signal levels relative to repeated signal levels.  In
        particular, a novel equalizer generates signal levels as a logical function\nof
        bit history to emphasize transition signal levels.  Preferred implementations
        define the logical function of bit history in a look up table.\n<BR><BR>In
        preferred embodiments, the equalizer converts an input signal, having discrete
        signal levels at an input data rate, to an output signal having a greater
        number of discrete signal levels at the input data rate.  In particular, the
        equalizer\ngenerates transmitted signal levels based on time since last signal
        transition.  A particularly simple implementation is based on whether a current
        bit is equal to an immediately previous bit.\n<BR><BR>The clock rates of circuitry
        can be reduced by multiplexing outputs of parallel logic circuits operating
        on different multiple bit inputs to generate the signal levels.  In an adaptive
        system, the level of equalization in the transmitter can be\nmodified as a
        function of signals detected at the receiver. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF

        density and speed of modern VLSI technology can be applied to overcome the
        I/O bottleneck they have created by building sophisticated I/O circuitry that
        compensates for the characteristics of the physical interconnect and cancels
        dominant\nsources of timing and voltage noise.  Such optimized I/O circuitry
        is capable of achieving I/O rates an order of magnitude higher than those
        commonly used today while operating at lower power levels.\n<BR><BR>A system
        embodying the invention can achieve a four Gbps signaling rate using 0.5 .mu.m
        CMOS circuits by controlling and compensating for characteristics of the transmission
        medium, by cancelling timing skew, and through careful management of\ntime
        and voltage noise.\n<BR><BR>FIG. 1 shows one channel of high-speed signalling
        system embodying the invention.  A transmitter module 22 accepts 8-bit parallel
        data at 400 MHz.  Each byte is coded into 10 bits for band-limiting and forward
        error correction and transmitted up\nto 3 m across a single differential transmission
        line.  The transmitter pre-emphasizes the signal to compensate for expected
        line characteristics.  The lossy transmission line as well as package and
        connector parasitics attenuate and distort the received\nwaveform, and it
        is further corrupted by noise coupled from adjacent lines and the power supply.
        \ The receiver 24 accepts this noisy, distorted signal and its own 400 MHz
        clock.  The receiver generates 4 GHz timing signals aligned to the received
        data,\nsamples the noisy signal, decodes the signal, and produces synchronous
        8-bit data out.\n<BR><BR>The availability of 4 Gbps electrical signalling
        will enable the design of low-cost, high-bandwidth digital systems.  The wide,
        slow buses around which many contemporary digital systems are organized can
        be replaced by point-to-point networks\nusing a single, or at most a few,
        high-speed serial channels resulting in significant reduction in chip and
        module pinouts and in power dissipation.  A network based on 400 MBytes/s
        serial channels, for example, has several times the bandwidth of a 133\nMBytes/s
        PCI-bus that requires about 80 lines.  Also, depending on its topology, the
        network permits several simultaneous transfers to take place at full rate.
        \ A group of eight parallel channels would provide sufficient bandwidth (3.2
        GBytes/s) for the\nCPU to memory connection of today's fastest processors.
        \ For modest distances (up to 30 m with 18 AWG wire), high-speed electrical
        signalling is an attractive alternative to optical communication in terms
        of cost, power, and board area for peripheral\nconnection and building-sized
        local-area networks.\n<BR><BR>Frequency-Dependent Attenuation Causes Intersymbol
        Interference\n<BR><BR>Skin-effect resistance causes the attenuation of a conventional
        transmission line to increase with frequency.  With a broadband signal, as
        typically used in digital systems, the superposition of unattenuated low-frequency
        signal components with\nattenuated high-frequency signal components causes
        intersymbol interference that degrades noise margins and reduces the maximum
        frequency at which the system can operate.\n<BR><BR>This effect is most pronounced
        in the case of a single 1 (0) in a field of 0s (1s) as illustrated in FIGS.
        2A and B. The figures show a 4 Gb/s signal (FIG. 2A) and the simulated result
        of passing this signal across 3 m of 24 AWG twisted pair\n(FIG. 2B).  The
        highest frequency of interest (2 GHz) is attenuated by -7.6 dB (42%).  The
        unattenuated low-frequency component of the signal causes the isolated high-frequency
        pulse to barely reach the midpoint of the signal swing giving no eye opening\nin
        a differential system and very little probability of correct detection.\n<BR><BR>The
        problem here is not the magnitude of the attenuation, but rather the interference
        caused by the frequency-dependent nature of the attenuation.  The high-frequency
        pulse has sufficient amplitude at the receiver for proper detection.  It is
        the\noffset of the pulse from the receiver threshold by low-frequency interference
        that causes the problem.  Later, we will see how using a transmitter equalizer
        to preemphasize the high-frequency components of the signal eliminates this
        problem.  However,\nfirst we will characterize the nature of this attenuation
        in more detail.\n<BR><BR>FIGS. 3A-D show the resistance per meter and the
        attenuation per meter as a function of frequency for a 30 AWG (d=128 mm) twisted
        pair with a differential impedance of 100 ohms (FIGS. 3A and 3B) and for a
        5 mil (d=125 mm) half-ounce (0.7 mil\nthick) 50 omhs (FIGS. 3C and 3D) stripguide.
        \ For the 30 AWG pair, the skin effect begins increasing resistance at 267
        KHz and results in an attenuation to 56% of the original magnitude (-5 dB)
        per meter of cable at our operating frequency of 2 GHz\ncorresponding to a
        bit rate of 4 Gb/s. Skin effect does not begin to effect the 5 mil PC trace
        until 43 MHz because of its thin vertical dimension.  The high DC resistance
        (6.8 omhs/m) of this line gives it a DC attenuation of 88% (-1.2 dB).  Above
        70\nMHz the attenuation rolls off rapidly reaching 40% (-8 dB) at 2 GHz.  The
        important parameter, however, is the difference between the DC and high-frequency
        attenuation which is 45% (-6.8 dB).\n<BR><BR>The effect of frequency dependent
        attenuation is graphically illustrated in the eye-diagrams of FIG. 4A-C. As
        shown in the waveform in FIG. 4A, without equalization, a high-frequency attenuation
        factor of A reduces the height of the eye opening\nto 2A-1 with the eye completely
        disappearing at A.ltoreq.0.5.  This height is the amount of effective signal
        swing available to tolerate other noise sources such as receiver offset, receiver
        sensitivity, crosstalk, reflections of previous bits, and\ncoupled supply
        noise.  Because the waveforms cross the receiver threshold offset from the
        center of the signal swing, the width of the eye is also reduced.  As illustrated
        in FIG. 4B, the leading edge of the attenuated pulse crosses the threshold
        at the\nnormal time.  The trailing edge, however, is advanced by t.sub.j.
        \ This data-dependent jitter causes greater sensitivity to skew and jitter
        in the signal or sampling clock and may introduce noise into the timing loop.\n<BR><BR>The
        waveform of FIG. 4C illustrates the situation when we equalize the signal
        by attenuating the DC and low frequency components so all components are attenuated
        by a factor of A. Here the height of the eye opening is A, considerably larger
        than\n2A-1, especially for large attenuations.  Also, because the waveforms
        cross at the midpoint of their swing, the width of the eye is a full bit-cell
        giving better tolerance of timing skew and jitter.\n<BR><BR>Preemphasizing
        Signal Transitions Equalizes Line Attenuation\n<BR><BR>Equalization eliminates
        the problem of frequency-dependent attenuation by filtering the transmitted
        or received waveform so the concatenation of the equalizing filter and the
        transmission line gives a flat frequency response.  With equalization,\nan
        isolated 1 (0) in a field of 0s (1s) crosses the receiver threshold at the
        midpoint of its swing, as shown in FIG. 4C, rather than being offset by an
        unattenuated DC component, as shown in FIG. 4A.  Narrow-band voice, video,
        and data modems have long\nused equalization to compensate for the linear
        portion of the line characteristics (Lee, Edward A., and Messerschmitt, David
        G., Digital Communication, Second Edition, Kluwer, 1994).  However, it has
        not been used to date in baseband signalling with a\nwide bandwidth (i.e.,
        greater than 100 MHz) over short distances.\n<BR><BR>We equalize the line
        using a 4 GHz FIR filter built into the current-mode transmitter.  The arrangement
        is similar to the use of Tomlinson preceding in a narrowband modem (Tomlinson,
        M., \"New Automatic Equalizer Employing Modulo Arithmetic,\"\nElectronic Letters,
        March 1971).  In a high-speed digital system it is much simpler to equalize
        at the transmitter than at the receiver, as is more commonly done in communication
        systems.  Equalizing at the transmitter allows us to use a simple receiver\nthat
        just samples a binary value at 4 GHz.  Equalizing at the receiver would require
        an A/D of at least a few bits resolution or a high-speed analog delay line,
        both difficult circuit design problems.  A discrete-time FIR equalizer is
        preferable to a\ncontinuous-time passive or active filter as it is more easily
        realized in a standard CMOS process.\n<BR><BR>After much experimentation we
        have selected a five-tap FIR filter that operates at the bit rate.  The weights
        are trained to match the filter to the frequency response of the line as described
        below.  For a 1 m 30 AWG line, the impulse response\nis shown in FIG. 5A.
        \ Each vertical line delimits a time interval of one bit-cell or 250 ps.  The
        filter has a high-pass response as shown in FIG. 5B.\n<BR><BR>As shown in
        FIGS. 6A-C, this filter cancels the low-pass attenuation of the line giving
        a fairly flat response over the frequency band of interest (the decade from
        200 MHz to 2 GHz).  We band-limit the transmitted signal via coding to eliminate\nfrequencies
        below 200 MHz.  The equalization band is limited by the length of the filter.
        \ Adding taps to the filter would widen the band.  We have selected five taps
        as a compromise between bandwidth and cost of equalization.\n<BR><BR>FIG.
        6A shows the frequency response of the filter, FIG. 6B shows the frequency
        response of the line and FIG. 6C shows the combination (the product) for 1
        m of 30 AWG cable.  The scale on FIG. 6C is compressed to exaggerate the effect.
        \ The\nfilter cancels the response of parasitics as well as the response of
        the line.  The response is flat to within 5% across the band of interest.\n<BR><BR>The
        filter results in all transitions being full-swing, while attenuating repeated
        bits.  FIG. 5D shows the response of the filter to an example data sequence
        shown in FIG. 5C (00001000001010111110000).  The example shows that each signal\ntransition
        goes full swing with the current stepped down to an attenuated level for repeated
        strings of 1s (0s).\n<BR><BR>FIGS. 7A and B illustrate the application of
        equalization to the example of FIGS. 2A and 2B.  FIG. 7A shows the filtered
        version of the original signal and FIG. 7B the received waveform.  With equalization
        the isolated pulses and high-frequency\nsegments of the signal are centered
        on the receiver threshold and have adequate eye openings for detection.\n<BR><BR>Circuit
        Implementations\n<BR><BR>Preferred implementations of the invention include
        finite input response (FIR) filters, and FIG. 8 illustrates one such implementation.
        \ In this case, a 5 tap filter has been selected as a balance between higher
        fractional bandwidth and circuit\ncomplexity.  With a greater number of taps,
        equalization can be obtained at lower frequencies.  The present design provides
        for equalization in a range of 100 MHz to 2 GHz.  By reducing to 2 or 3 taps,
        the lower end of the range may be no less than 500\nMHz.\n<BR><BR>As in a
        conventional FIR filter, the input D.sub.i is delayed in successive delay
        elements 28.  However, rather than weighting the individual delayed signals
        and summing the weighted signals to obtain the desired output, the delayed
        signals are\napplied to a 5-to-32 decoder 32.\n<BR><BR>One of the 32 output
        bits from the decoder 32 is high with any input state and that high bit addresses
        a 4 bit word from the 32.times.4 random access memory 34.  The memory 34 is
        shown to be random access in order to allow for reprogramming of\nthe equalization
        using a training process below.  However, the system may be a fixed design
        which can be implemented using a read only memory.\n<BR><BR>The 4 bit output
        from RAM 34 defines one of the 15 output levels generated by a digital-to-analog
        converter 36 and applied to the transmission line 38.  Those levels include
        0, seven positive levels where Dout- is pulled low, and seven negative\nlevels
        where Dout+ is pulled low.\n<BR><BR>To simplify the implementation, each FIR
        filter is approximated by a transition filter implemented with a look-up table
        as illustrated in FIG. 9.  The transition filter compares, in logic elements
        40, the current data bit D.sub.i to each of the\nlast four bits, and uses
        a find-first-one unit 42 to determine the number of bits since the last signal
        transition.  The result is used to look up a 3-bit drive strength for the
        current bit from a 15-bit serially-loaded RAM 44.  The drive strength is\nmultiplied
        by the current bit with two sets of three NAND gates 46, 48 to generate three-bit
        high and low drive signals for the DAC.\n<BR><BR>While the transition filter
        is a non-linear element, it closely approximates the response of an FIR filter
        for the impulse functions needed to equalize typical transmission lines.  Making
        this approximation greatly reduces the size and delay of\nthe filter as a
        96-bit RAM would be required to implement a full 5-tap FIR filter via a lookup
        table and the gates 46 and 48.\n<BR><BR>The transition filter can be simplified
        even further to the simple logic circuit of FIG. 10 which operates as a two
        tap filter.  The input signal D.sub.i is delayed in a single delay element
        50 to produce the signal D.sub.i-1.  The two signals\nare combined in an exclusive-OR
        gate 52 to determine whether the current bit is equal to the immediately previous
        bit.  If so, the lower magnitude output is generated by the digital-to-analog
        converter 54.  If, on the other hand, there has been a\ntransition since the
        previous bit, the output is emphasized.  Thus, this simple circuit provides
        four output levels, two positive and two negative.\n<BR><BR>In yet another
        two-tap embodiment, with a transition, full current drive is used in opposite
        directions on both sides of the transition.  When the signal value remains
        unchanged, an attenuated current drive is used.\n<BR><BR>The circuit design
        of the DAC used in the FIG. 9 embodiment is shown in FIGS. 11A and B. As shown
        in FIG. 11A, each DAC module is composed of three progressively sized differential
        pulse generators 56, 58 and 60.  Each generator is enabled to\nproduce a current
        pulse on Dout+ (Dout-) if the corresponding H (L) line is low.  If neither
        line is low no pulse is produced.  Depending on the current bit and the three-bit
        value read from the RAM 44 in the filter module, 15 different current values\nare
        possible (nominally from -8.75 mA to +8.75 ma in 1.25 mA steps).  The timing
        of the pulse is controlled by a pair of clocks.  A low-going on-clock .o slashed..sub.i
        gates the pulse on its falling edge.  The high-true off clock .o slashed..sub.i+1\ngates
        the pulse off 250 ps later.\n<BR><BR>Each of the three differential pulse
        generators is implemented as shown in FIG. 11B.  A pre-drive stage 62 inverts
        the on-clock in inverter 64 and qualifies the off-clock with the enable signals
        in NOR gates 66 and 68.  A low (true) enable\nsignal, which must be stable
        while the off-clock is low, turns on one of the two output transistors 70,
        72, priming the circuit for the arrival of the on-clock.  When the on-clock
        falls, the common tail transistor 74 is turned on, starting the current\npulse.
        \ When the off-clock rises, the selected output transistor terminates the
        current pulse.  The delay of the qualifying NOR-gate is carefully matched
        against that of the on-clock inverter to avoid distorting the pulse width.\n<BR><BR>To
        enable operation of the equalization circuit at rates in the order of gigahertz
        while using circuitry operating only in the order of hundreds of megahertz,
        the preferred embodiment generates the signal levels by multiplexing outputs
        of\nparallel logic circuits operating on different multiple bit inputs.\n<BR><BR>A
        block diagram of the multiplexed transmitter is shown in FIG. 12.  The transmitter
        accepts 10 bits of data, D.sub.0-9, at 400 MHz.  A distribution block 76 delivers
        5 bits of data to each of 10 FIR filters 78.  The ith filter receives bit\nD.sub.i
        and the four previous bits.  For the first four filters this involves delaying
        bits from the previous clock cycle.  The distribution also retimes the filter
        inputs to the clock domain of the filter.  Each filter 78 is a 5-tap transition
        filter\nthat produces a 4-bit output encoded as 3 bits of positive drive and
        3 bits of negative drive.  These six bits from the filter directly select
        which of six pulse generators in the DAC 80 connected to that filter are enabled.
        \ The enabled pulse generators\nare sequenced by the 10-phase clock 82.  The
        ith pulse generator is gated on by .o slashed..sub.i and gated off by .o slashed..sub.i+1.
        \ To meet the timing requirements of the pulse generator, the ith filter operates
        off of clock .o slashed..sub.i+1.\n<BR><BR>A training sequence may be used
        to initialize the transmitter pre-emphasis filter at powerup.  Training is
        performed under the control of a supervisory processor 26 that interfaces
        with the transmitter on one end of the line and the receiver on\nthe other
        end via a low-speed serial scan chain.  A preliminary version of a training
        sequence for one channel is as follows:\n<BR><BR>1.  The frequency response
        of the line is measured.  The transmitter is commanded to turn off precompensation
        and send an alternating sequence of 1s and 0s.  The receiver measures the
        level of the received signal by using a feedback transmitter\nto shift the
        DC operating point of the sense-amplifiers.  The process is repeated at other
        bit rates to trace out the attenuation curve.  For example, bit rates of R.sub.max,
        R.sub.max /2, R.sub.max /3 .  . . may be tested.\n<BR><BR>2.  Based on the
        attenuation measurements taken in (1), the transmitter equalization is set
        by programming the FIR filter and/or DAC.\n<BR><BR>CONCLUSION\n<BR><BR>Transmitter
        equalization extends the data rates and distances over which electronic digital
        signalling can be reliably used.  Preemphasizing the high-frequency components
        of the signal compensates for the low-pass frequency response of the\npackage
        and transmission line.  This prevents the unattenuated low-frequency components
        from interfering with high-frequency pulses by causing offsets that prevent
        detection.  With equalization an isolated pulse at the receiver has the same
        amplitude as\na long string of repeated bits.  This gives a clean received
        signal with a good eye opening in both the time and voltage dimensions.\n<BR><BR>In
        one embodiment, we implement equalization for a 4 Gbs signalling system by
        building a 4 GHz, five-tap FIR filter into the transmitter.  This filter is
        simple to implement yet equalizes the frequency response to within 5% across
        the band of\ninterest.  The filter is realized using 0.5 Mm CMOS circuitry
        operating at 400 MHz using a bank of 10 filters and DACs sequenced by a 10-phase
        400 MHz clock.  Narrow drive periods are realized using series gating to combine
        two clock phases, an on-phase\nand off-phase, in each DAC.  We have simulated
        extracted layout of the equalized transmitter driving a load through package
        parasitics and 1 m of differential strip guide to demonstrate the feasibility
        of this approach.\n<BR><BR>The equalizing transmitter described here is one
        component of a 4 Gbs signalling system we are currently developing for implementation
        in an 0.5 .mu.m CMOS technology.  The system also relies on low-jitter timing
        circuitry, automatic per-line\nskew compensation, a narrow-aperture receive
        amplifier, and careful package design.\n<BR><BR>The availability of 4 Gbs
        serial channels in a commodity CMOS technology will enable a range of system
        opportunities.  The ubiquitous system bus can be replaced by a lower-cost
        yet higher-speed point-to-point network.  A single hub chip with 32\nserial
        ports can directly provide the interconnection for most systems and can be
        assembled into more sophisticated networks for larger systems.  A single 4
        Gbs serial channel provides adequate bandwidth for most system components
        and multiple channels\ncan be ganged in parallel for higher bandwidths.\n<BR><BR>A
        4 Gbs serial channel can also be used as a replacement technology at both
        the component and system level.  At the component level, a single serial channel
        (two pins) replaces 40 100 MHz pins.  A 4 GByte/s CPU to L2 cache interface,
        for example,\ncould be implemented with just eight serial channels.  At the
        system level, high-speed electrical serial channels are a direct replacement
        for expensive optical interconnect.  Using 18 AWG wire, these channels will
        operate up to lengths of 10 m enabling\nhigh-bandwidth, low-cost peripheral
        connections and local-area networks.  Inexpensive electrical repeaters can
        be used to operate over substantially longer distances.\n<BR><BR>Even with
        4 Gbs channels, system bandwidth remains a major problem for system designers.
        \ On-chip logic bandwidth (gates.times.speed) is increasing at a rate of 90%
        per year (60% gates and 20% speed).  The density and bandwidth of system\ninterconnect
        is increasing at a much slower rate of about 20% per year as they are limited
        by mechanical factors that are on a slower growth curve than that of semiconductor
        lithography.  A major challenge for designers is to use scarce system\ninterconnect
        resources effectively, both through the design of sophisticated signalling
        systems that use all available wire bandwidth and through system architectures
        that exploit locality to reduce the demands on this bandwidth.\n<BR><BR>While
        this invention has been particularly shown and described with references to
        preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the
        art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing
        from\nthe spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.\n<BR><BR><CENTER><B>*
