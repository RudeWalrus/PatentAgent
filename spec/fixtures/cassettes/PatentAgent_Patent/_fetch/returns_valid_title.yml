        \        <BR><CENTER><B>Abstract</B></CENTER>\n         <P>An equalizer provided
        in a digital transmitter compensates for attenuation\n     in a signal channel
        to a digital receiver. The equalizer generates signal\n     levels as a logical
        function of bit history to emphasize transition signal\n     levels relative
        to repeated signal levels. The preferred equalizer\n     includes an FIR transition
        filter using a look-up table. Parallel circuits\n     including FIR filters
        and digital-to-analog converters provide a high\n     speed equalizer with
        lower speed circuitry. The equalizer is particularly\n     suited to in-cabinet
        and local area network transmissions where feedback\n     circuitry facilitates
        adaptive training of the equalizer.\n</P>\n         <HR>\n<TABLE WIDTH=\"100%\">

        OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR>The performance of many digital systems is limited
        by the interconnection bandwidth between chips, boards, and cabinets.  As
        VLSI technology continues to scale, system bandwidth will become an even more
        significant bottleneck as the number of\nI/Os scales more slowly than the
        bandwidth demands of on-chip logic.  Also, off-chip signalling rates have
        historically scaled more slowly than on-chip clock rates.  Most digital systems
        today use full-swing unterminated signalling methods that are\nunsuited for
        data rates over 100 MHz on one meter wires.  Even good current-mode signalling
        methods with matched terminations and carefully controlled line and connector
        impedance are limited to about 1 GHz by the frequency-dependent attenuation
        of\ncopper lines.  Without new approaches to high-speed signalling, bandwidth
        will stop scaling with technology when we reach these limits.\n<BR><BR>SUMMARY
        OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR>Conventional approaches to dealing with frequency
        dependent attenuation on transmission lines have been based on equalization,
        either in the transmitter or the receiver.  For example, Tomlinson preceding
        is used in modems, and digital\nequalization in binary communication channels
        has been suggested in U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,374,426 to Burlage et al. However,
        such systems cannot scale to very high data rate binary or multilevel systems
        having bandwidths extending from near DC to greater\nthan 100 MHz.  Above
        100 MHz, there is substantial attenuation due to skin effect resistance on
        conventional transmission lines.\n<BR><BR>The present invention enables equalizers
        which can be implemented as digital filters operating at acceptable clock
        speeds.  For example, a three gigabit per second (Gbps) system can be implemented
        using 400 Mbps circuitry.  The invention has\nparticular application to nonmodulated,
        high data rate, binary or multilevel systems as found locally within a data
        processor cabinet or on a local area network.\n<BR><BR>In accordance with
        the present invention, a digital transmitter comprises an equalizer which
        emphasizes transition signal levels relative to repeated signal levels.  In
        particular, a novel equalizer generates signal levels as a logical function\nof
        bit history to emphasize transition signal levels.  Preferred implementations
        define the logical function of bit history in a look up table.\n<BR><BR>In
        preferred embodiments, the equalizer converts an input signal, having discrete
        signal levels at an input data rate, to an output signal having a greater
        number of discrete signal levels at the input data rate.  In particular, the
        equalizer\ngenerates transmitted signal levels based on time since last signal
        transition.  A particularly simple implementation is based on whether a current
        bit is equal to an immediately previous bit.\n<BR><BR>The clock rates of circuitry
        can be reduced by multiplexing outputs of parallel logic circuits operating
        on different multiple bit inputs to generate the signal levels.  In an adaptive
        system, the level of equalization in the transmitter can be\nmodified as a
        function of signals detected at the receiver. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF

        density and speed of modern VLSI technology can be applied to overcome the
        I/O bottleneck they have created by building sophisticated I/O circuitry that
        compensates for the characteristics of the physical interconnect and cancels
        dominant\nsources of timing and voltage noise.  Such optimized I/O circuitry
        is capable of achieving I/O rates an order of magnitude higher than those
        commonly used today while operating at lower power levels.\n<BR><BR>A system
        embodying the invention can achieve a four Gbps signaling rate using 0.5 .mu.m
        CMOS circuits by controlling and compensating for characteristics of the transmission
        medium, by cancelling timing skew, and through careful management of\ntime
        and voltage noise.\n<BR><BR>FIG. 1 shows one channel of high-speed signalling
        system embodying the invention.  A transmitter module 22 accepts 8-bit parallel
        data at 400 MHz.  Each byte is coded into 10 bits for band-limiting and forward
        error correction and transmitted up\nto 3 m across a single differential transmission
        line.  The transmitter pre-emphasizes the signal to compensate for expected
        line characteristics.  The lossy transmission line as well as package and
        connector parasitics attenuate and distort the received\nwaveform, and it
        is further corrupted by noise coupled from adjacent lines and the power supply.
        \ The receiver 24 accepts this noisy, distorted signal and its own 400 MHz
        clock.  The receiver generates 4 GHz timing signals aligned to the received
        data,\nsamples the noisy signal, decodes the signal, and produces synchronous
        8-bit data out.\n<BR><BR>The availability of 4 Gbps electrical signalling
        will enable the design of low-cost, high-bandwidth digital systems.  The wide,
        slow buses around which many contemporary digital systems are organized can
        be replaced by point-to-point networks\nusing a single, or at most a few,
        high-speed serial channels resulting in significant reduction in chip and
        module pinouts and in power dissipation.  A network based on 400 MBytes/s
        serial channels, for example, has several times the bandwidth of a 133\nMBytes/s
        PCI-bus that requires about 80 lines.  Also, depending on its topology, the
        network permits several simultaneous transfers to take place at full rate.
        \ A group of eight parallel channels would provide sufficient bandwidth (3.2
        GBytes/s) for the\nCPU to memory connection of today's fastest processors.
        \ For modest distances (up to 30 m with 18 AWG wire), high-speed electrical
        signalling is an attractive alternative to optical communication in terms
        of cost, power, and board area for peripheral\nconnection and building-sized
        local-area networks.\n<BR><BR>Frequency-Dependent Attenuation Causes Intersymbol
        Interference\n<BR><BR>Skin-effect resistance causes the attenuation of a conventional
        transmission line to increase with frequency.  With a broadband signal, as
        typically used in digital systems, the superposition of unattenuated low-frequency
        signal components with\nattenuated high-frequency signal components causes
        intersymbol interference that degrades noise margins and reduces the maximum
        frequency at which the system can operate.\n<BR><BR>This effect is most pronounced
        in the case of a single 1 (0) in a field of 0s (1s) as illustrated in FIGS.
        2A and B. The figures show a 4 Gb/s signal (FIG. 2A) and the simulated result
        of passing this signal across 3 m of 24 AWG twisted pair\n(FIG. 2B).  The
        highest frequency of interest (2 GHz) is attenuated by -7.6 dB (42%).  The
        unattenuated low-frequency component of the signal causes the isolated high-frequency
        pulse to barely reach the midpoint of the signal swing giving no eye opening\nin
        a differential system and very little probability of correct detection.\n<BR><BR>The
        problem here is not the magnitude of the attenuation, but rather the interference
        caused by the frequency-dependent nature of the attenuation.  The high-frequency
        pulse has sufficient amplitude at the receiver for proper detection.  It is
        the\noffset of the pulse from the receiver threshold by low-frequency interference
        that causes the problem.  Later, we will see how using a transmitter equalizer
        to preemphasize the high-frequency components of the signal eliminates this
        problem.  However,\nfirst we will characterize the nature of this attenuation
        in more detail.\n<BR><BR>FIGS. 3A-D show the resistance per meter and the
        attenuation per meter as a function of frequency for a 30 AWG (d=128 mm) twisted
        pair with a differential impedance of 100 ohms (FIGS. 3A and 3B) and for a
        5 mil (d=125 mm) half-ounce (0.7 mil\nthick) 50 omhs (FIGS. 3C and 3D) stripguide.
        \ For the 30 AWG pair, the skin effect begins increasing resistance at 267
        KHz and results in an attenuation to 56% of the original magnitude (-5 dB)
        per meter of cable at our operating frequency of 2 GHz\ncorresponding to a
        bit rate of 4 Gb/s. Skin effect does not begin to effect the 5 mil PC trace
        until 43 MHz because of its thin vertical dimension.  The high DC resistance
        (6.8 omhs/m) of this line gives it a DC attenuation of 88% (-1.2 dB).  Above
        70\nMHz the attenuation rolls off rapidly reaching 40% (-8 dB) at 2 GHz.  The
        important parameter, however, is the difference between the DC and high-frequency
        attenuation which is 45% (-6.8 dB).\n<BR><BR>The effect of frequency dependent
        attenuation is graphically illustrated in the eye-diagrams of FIG. 4A-C. As
        shown in the waveform in FIG. 4A, without equalization, a high-frequency attenuation
        factor of A reduces the height of the eye opening\nto 2A-1 with the eye completely
        disappearing at A.ltoreq.0.5.  This height is the amount of effective signal
        swing available to tolerate other noise sources such as receiver offset, receiver
        sensitivity, crosstalk, reflections of previous bits, and\ncoupled supply
        noise.  Because the waveforms cross the receiver threshold offset from the
        center of the signal swing, the width of the eye is also reduced.  As illustrated
        in FIG. 4B, the leading edge of the attenuated pulse crosses the threshold
        at the\nnormal time.  The trailing edge, however, is advanced by t.sub.j.
        \ This data-dependent jitter causes greater sensitivity to skew and jitter
        in the signal or sampling clock and may introduce noise into the timing loop.\n<BR><BR>The
        waveform of FIG. 4C illustrates the situation when we equalize the signal
        by attenuating the DC and low frequency components so all components are attenuated
        by a factor of A. Here the height of the eye opening is A, considerably larger
        than\n2A-1, especially for large attenuations.  Also, because the waveforms
        cross at the midpoint of their swing, the width of the eye is a full bit-cell
        giving better tolerance of timing skew and jitter.\n<BR><BR>Preemphasizing
        Signal Transitions Equalizes Line Attenuation\n<BR><BR>Equalization eliminates
        the problem of frequency-dependent attenuation by filtering the transmitted
        or received waveform so the concatenation of the equalizing filter and the
        transmission line gives a flat frequency response.  With equalization,\nan
        isolated 1 (0) in a field of 0s (1s) crosses the receiver threshold at the
        midpoint of its swing, as shown in FIG. 4C, rather than being offset by an
        unattenuated DC component, as shown in FIG. 4A.  Narrow-band voice, video,
        and data modems have long\nused equalization to compensate for the linear
        portion of the line characteristics (Lee, Edward A., and Messerschmitt, David
        G., Digital Communication, Second Edition, Kluwer, 1994).  However, it has
        not been used to date in baseband signalling with a\nwide bandwidth (i.e.,
        greater than 100 MHz) over short distances.\n<BR><BR>We equalize the line
        using a 4 GHz FIR filter built into the current-mode transmitter.  The arrangement
        is similar to the use of Tomlinson preceding in a narrowband modem (Tomlinson,
        M., \"New Automatic Equalizer Employing Modulo Arithmetic,\"\nElectronic Letters,
        March 1971).  In a high-speed digital system it is much simpler to equalize
        at the transmitter than at the receiver, as is more commonly done in communication
        systems.  Equalizing at the transmitter allows us to use a simple receiver\nthat
        just samples a binary value at 4 GHz.  Equalizing at the receiver would require
        an A/D of at least a few bits resolution or a high-speed analog delay line,
        both difficult circuit design problems.  A discrete-time FIR equalizer is
        preferable to a\ncontinuous-time passive or active filter as it is more easily
        realized in a standard CMOS process.\n<BR><BR>After much experimentation we
        have selected a five-tap FIR filter that operates at the bit rate.  The weights
        are trained to match the filter to the frequency response of the line as described
        below.  For a 1 m 30 AWG line, the impulse response\nis shown in FIG. 5A.
        \ Each vertical line delimits a time interval of one bit-cell or 250 ps.  The
        filter has a high-pass response as shown in FIG. 5B.\n<BR><BR>As shown in
        FIGS. 6A-C, this filter cancels the low-pass attenuation of the line giving
        a fairly flat response over the frequency band of interest (the decade from
        200 MHz to 2 GHz).  We band-limit the transmitted signal via coding to eliminate\nfrequencies
        below 200 MHz.  The equalization band is limited by the length of the filter.
        \ Adding taps to the filter would widen the band.  We have selected five taps
        as a compromise between bandwidth and cost of equalization.\n<BR><BR>FIG.
        6A shows the frequency response of the filter, FIG. 6B shows the frequency
        response of the line and FIG. 6C shows the combination (the product) for 1
        m of 30 AWG cable.  The scale on FIG. 6C is compressed to exaggerate the effect.
        \ The\nfilter cancels the response of parasitics as well as the response of
        the line.  The response is flat to within 5% across the band of interest.\n<BR><BR>The
        filter results in all transitions being full-swing, while attenuating repeated
        bits.  FIG. 5D shows the response of the filter to an example data sequence
        shown in FIG. 5C (00001000001010111110000).  The example shows that each signal\ntransition
        goes full swing with the current stepped down to an attenuated level for repeated
        strings of 1s (0s).\n<BR><BR>FIGS. 7A and B illustrate the application of
        equalization to the example of FIGS. 2A and 2B.  FIG. 7A shows the filtered
        version of the original signal and FIG. 7B the received waveform.  With equalization
        the isolated pulses and high-frequency\nsegments of the signal are centered
        on the receiver threshold and have adequate eye openings for detection.\n<BR><BR>Circuit
        Implementations\n<BR><BR>Preferred implementations of the invention include
        finite input response (FIR) filters, and FIG. 8 illustrates one such implementation.
        \ In this case, a 5 tap filter has been selected as a balance between higher
        fractional bandwidth and circuit\ncomplexity.  With a greater number of taps,
        equalization can be obtained at lower frequencies.  The present design provides
        for equalization in a range of 100 MHz to 2 GHz.  By reducing to 2 or 3 taps,
        the lower end of the range may be no less than 500\nMHz.\n<BR><BR>As in a
        conventional FIR filter, the input D.sub.i is delayed in successive delay
        elements 28.  However, rather than weighting the individual delayed signals
        and summing the weighted signals to obtain the desired output, the delayed
        signals are\napplied to a 5-to-32 decoder 32.\n<BR><BR>One of the 32 output
        bits from the decoder 32 is high with any input state and that high bit addresses
        a 4 bit word from the 32.times.4 random access memory 34.  The memory 34 is
        shown to be random access in order to allow for reprogramming of\nthe equalization
        using a training process below.  However, the system may be a fixed design
        which can be implemented using a read only memory.\n<BR><BR>The 4 bit output
        from RAM 34 defines one of the 15 output levels generated by a digital-to-analog
        converter 36 and applied to the transmission line 38.  Those levels include
        0, seven positive levels where Dout- is pulled low, and seven negative\nlevels
        where Dout+ is pulled low.\n<BR><BR>To simplify the implementation, each FIR
        filter is approximated by a transition filter implemented with a look-up table
        as illustrated in FIG. 9.  The transition filter compares, in logic elements
        40, the current data bit D.sub.i to each of the\nlast four bits, and uses
        a find-first-one unit 42 to determine the number of bits since the last signal
        transition.  The result is used to look up a 3-bit drive strength for the
        current bit from a 15-bit serially-loaded RAM 44.  The drive strength is\nmultiplied
        by the current bit with two sets of three NAND gates 46, 48 to generate three-bit
        high and low drive signals for the DAC.\n<BR><BR>While the transition filter
        is a non-linear element, it closely approximates the response of an FIR filter
        for the impulse functions needed to equalize typical transmission lines.  Making
        this approximation greatly reduces the size and delay of\nthe filter as a
        96-bit RAM would be required to implement a full 5-tap FIR filter via a lookup
        table and the gates 46 and 48.\n<BR><BR>The transition filter can be simplified
        even further to the simple logic circuit of FIG. 10 which operates as a two
        tap filter.  The input signal D.sub.i is delayed in a single delay element
        50 to produce the signal D.sub.i-1.  The two signals\nare combined in an exclusive-OR
        gate 52 to determine whether the current bit is equal to the immediately previous
        bit.  If so, the lower magnitude output is generated by the digital-to-analog
        converter 54.  If, on the other hand, there has been a\ntransition since the
        previous bit, the output is emphasized.  Thus, this simple circuit provides
        four output levels, two positive and two negative.\n<BR><BR>In yet another
        two-tap embodiment, with a transition, full current drive is used in opposite
        directions on both sides of the transition.  When the signal value remains
        unchanged, an attenuated current drive is used.\n<BR><BR>The circuit design
        of the DAC used in the FIG. 9 embodiment is shown in FIGS. 11A and B. As shown
        in FIG. 11A, each DAC module is composed of three progressively sized differential
        pulse generators 56, 58 and 60.  Each generator is enabled to\nproduce a current
        pulse on Dout+ (Dout-) if the corresponding H (L) line is low.  If neither
        line is low no pulse is produced.  Depending on the current bit and the three-bit
        value read from the RAM 44 in the filter module, 15 different current values\nare
        possible (nominally from -8.75 mA to +8.75 ma in 1.25 mA steps).  The timing
        of the pulse is controlled by a pair of clocks.  A low-going on-clock .o slashed..sub.i
        gates the pulse on its falling edge.  The high-true off clock .o slashed..sub.i+1\ngates
        the pulse off 250 ps later.\n<BR><BR>Each of the three differential pulse
        generators is implemented as shown in FIG. 11B.  A pre-drive stage 62 inverts
        the on-clock in inverter 64 and qualifies the off-clock with the enable signals
        in NOR gates 66 and 68.  A low (true) enable\nsignal, which must be stable
        while the off-clock is low, turns on one of the two output transistors 70,
        72, priming the circuit for the arrival of the on-clock.  When the on-clock
        falls, the common tail transistor 74 is turned on, starting the current\npulse.
        \ When the off-clock rises, the selected output transistor terminates the
        current pulse.  The delay of the qualifying NOR-gate is carefully matched
        against that of the on-clock inverter to avoid distorting the pulse width.\n<BR><BR>To
        enable operation of the equalization circuit at rates in the order of gigahertz
        while using circuitry operating only in the order of hundreds of megahertz,
        the preferred embodiment generates the signal levels by multiplexing outputs
        of\nparallel logic circuits operating on different multiple bit inputs.\n<BR><BR>A
        block diagram of the multiplexed transmitter is shown in FIG. 12.  The transmitter
        accepts 10 bits of data, D.sub.0-9, at 400 MHz.  A distribution block 76 delivers
        5 bits of data to each of 10 FIR filters 78.  The ith filter receives bit\nD.sub.i
        and the four previous bits.  For the first four filters this involves delaying
        bits from the previous clock cycle.  The distribution also retimes the filter
        inputs to the clock domain of the filter.  Each filter 78 is a 5-tap transition
        filter\nthat produces a 4-bit output encoded as 3 bits of positive drive and
        3 bits of negative drive.  These six bits from the filter directly select
        which of six pulse generators in the DAC 80 connected to that filter are enabled.
        \ The enabled pulse generators\nare sequenced by the 10-phase clock 82.  The
        ith pulse generator is gated on by .o slashed..sub.i and gated off by .o slashed..sub.i+1.
        \ To meet the timing requirements of the pulse generator, the ith filter operates
        off of clock .o slashed..sub.i+1.\n<BR><BR>A training sequence may be used
        to initialize the transmitter pre-emphasis filter at powerup.  Training is
        performed under the control of a supervisory processor 26 that interfaces
        with the transmitter on one end of the line and the receiver on\nthe other
        end via a low-speed serial scan chain.  A preliminary version of a training
        sequence for one channel is as follows:\n<BR><BR>1.  The frequency response
        of the line is measured.  The transmitter is commanded to turn off precompensation
        and send an alternating sequence of 1s and 0s.  The receiver measures the
        level of the received signal by using a feedback transmitter\nto shift the
        DC operating point of the sense-amplifiers.  The process is repeated at other
        bit rates to trace out the attenuation curve.  For example, bit rates of R.sub.max,
        R.sub.max /2, R.sub.max /3 .  . . may be tested.\n<BR><BR>2.  Based on the
        attenuation measurements taken in (1), the transmitter equalization is set
        by programming the FIR filter and/or DAC.\n<BR><BR>CONCLUSION\n<BR><BR>Transmitter
        equalization extends the data rates and distances over which electronic digital
        signalling can be reliably used.  Preemphasizing the high-frequency components
        of the signal compensates for the low-pass frequency response of the\npackage
        and transmission line.  This prevents the unattenuated low-frequency components
        from interfering with high-frequency pulses by causing offsets that prevent
        detection.  With equalization an isolated pulse at the receiver has the same
        amplitude as\na long string of repeated bits.  This gives a clean received
        signal with a good eye opening in both the time and voltage dimensions.\n<BR><BR>In
        one embodiment, we implement equalization for a 4 Gbs signalling system by
        building a 4 GHz, five-tap FIR filter into the transmitter.  This filter is
        simple to implement yet equalizes the frequency response to within 5% across
        the band of\ninterest.  The filter is realized using 0.5 Mm CMOS circuitry
        operating at 400 MHz using a bank of 10 filters and DACs sequenced by a 10-phase
        400 MHz clock.  Narrow drive periods are realized using series gating to combine
        two clock phases, an on-phase\nand off-phase, in each DAC.  We have simulated
        extracted layout of the equalized transmitter driving a load through package
        parasitics and 1 m of differential strip guide to demonstrate the feasibility
        of this approach.\n<BR><BR>The equalizing transmitter described here is one
        component of a 4 Gbs signalling system we are currently developing for implementation
        in an 0.5 .mu.m CMOS technology.  The system also relies on low-jitter timing
        circuitry, automatic per-line\nskew compensation, a narrow-aperture receive
        amplifier, and careful package design.\n<BR><BR>The availability of 4 Gbs
        serial channels in a commodity CMOS technology will enable a range of system
        opportunities.  The ubiquitous system bus can be replaced by a lower-cost
        yet higher-speed point-to-point network.  A single hub chip with 32\nserial
        ports can directly provide the interconnection for most systems and can be
        assembled into more sophisticated networks for larger systems.  A single 4
        Gbs serial channel provides adequate bandwidth for most system components
        and multiple channels\ncan be ganged in parallel for higher bandwidths.\n<BR><BR>A
        4 Gbs serial channel can also be used as a replacement technology at both
        the component and system level.  At the component level, a single serial channel
        (two pins) replaces 40 100 MHz pins.  A 4 GByte/s CPU to L2 cache interface,
        for example,\ncould be implemented with just eight serial channels.  At the
        system level, high-speed electrical serial channels are a direct replacement
        for expensive optical interconnect.  Using 18 AWG wire, these channels will
        operate up to lengths of 10 m enabling\nhigh-bandwidth, low-cost peripheral
        connections and local-area networks.  Inexpensive electrical repeaters can
        be used to operate over substantially longer distances.\n<BR><BR>Even with
        4 Gbs channels, system bandwidth remains a major problem for system designers.
        \ On-chip logic bandwidth (gates.times.speed) is increasing at a rate of 90%
        per year (60% gates and 20% speed).  The density and bandwidth of system\ninterconnect
        is increasing at a much slower rate of about 20% per year as they are limited
        by mechanical factors that are on a slower growth curve than that of semiconductor
        lithography.  A major challenge for designers is to use scarce system\ninterconnect
        resources effectively, both through the design of sophisticated signalling
        systems that use all available wire bandwidth and through system architectures
        that exploit locality to reduce the demands on this bandwidth.\n<BR><BR>While
        this invention has been particularly shown and described with references to
        preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the
        art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing
        from\nthe spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.\n<BR><BR><CENTER><B>*

        \ .sctn.119 from Japanese Patent\nApplication No. 2007-156270 filed Jun.  13,
        2007, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.\n<BR><BR>BACKGROUND
        OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR> 1.  Field of the Invention\n<BR><BR> The present
        invention relates to an imaging apparatus and a method for driving the imaging
        apparatus, in particular, to an imaging apparatus equipped with an imaging
        device having pixels for detecting colors of each of R (red), G (green), B\n(blue),
        and a pixel for detecting luminance of W (white), and to a method for driving
        the apparatus.\n<BR><BR> 2.  Description of Related Art\n<BR><BR> A solid-state
        imaging device for photographing color images to be mounted on a digital camera
        has color filters of, for example, Bayer-arrayed three primary colors of R,
        G and B. However, if only color filters of R, G and B are used, the\nluminance
        resolution of a taken image deteriorates when an object has unbalanced color.\n<BR><BR>
        Consequently, conventionally, among respective pixels constituting a solid-state
        imaging device, checkerwise disposed pixels are used as pixels for detecting
        luminance, and each of color filters of R, G, B three primary colors is formed
        on\nrespective pixels at remaining checkerwise disposed positions, so that
        the luminance resolution of a raken image does not depend on the color of
        an object.\n<BR><BR> When a digital camera mounted with a solid-state imaging
        device for photographing a color image, in which pixels for detecting luminance
        are formed, is used for photographing, for example, moving images, there is
        such a case that reduced image\ndata are read out from the solid-state imaging
        device in order to enhance the frame rate.  On this occasion, image data are
        not read out from pixels for detecting luminance, but image data are read
        out only from pixels for detecting color having a color\nfilter of R, G or
        B, thereby making image resolution one-half both longitudinally and horizontally
        with high accuracy.  However, in recent solid-state imaging devices, the high
        pixelation has reached the technical limit and a signal charge amount that\ncan
        be received with one pixel is very small.  Accordingly, when image data are
        read out from a solid-state imaging device while performing pixel skipping,
        the luminance sensitivity becomes low.\n<BR><BR> In order to solve the problem,
        JP-A-2006-157600 or US 2006/0139468 A1 realizes to obtain images reduced to
        one-half without lowering the luminance sensitivity by reading out pixel date
        without performing the skipping when reading out reduced\nimage data from
        a solid-state imaging device.\n<BR><BR> Meanwhile, in the solid-state imaging
        device as disclosed in JP-A-2006-157600 or US 2006/0139468 A1, a filter Y
        for detecting luminance or a color filter R, G or B is provided on the surface
        of individual pixel disposed and formed longitudinally\nand horizontally.
        \ The filter Y is provided on the surface of pixels that are disposed at checked
        positions, and the color filter R, G or B is provided on the surface of pixels
        that are disposed at remaining checked positions.  On the individual surfaces\nof
        pixels in even-numbered lines, filters are so arranged as \"Y, G, Y, G, .
        \ . . \", and on the individual surfaces of pixels in odd-numbered lines,
        a line in which filters are so arranged as \"R, Y, B, Y, R, .  . . \" and
        a line in which filters are so\narranged as \"B, Y, R, Y, B, .  . . \" are
        disposed alternately.  Then, when image data taken with the solid-state imaging
        device are used to generate a reduced image having one-half resolution both
        longitudinally and horizontally, in this embodiment,\nimage data of two pixels
        adjacent to each other in the longitudinal direction (vertical direction)
        are added and read out from the solid-state imaging device.  Here, the pair
        of two pixels in the longitudinal direction is constituted of a Y pixel being
        a\npixel having the filter Y and a pixel having any one of color filters R,
        G and B, and the pair vertically adjacent to a pair constituted of an R pixel
        and a Y pixel is a pair constituted of a B pixel and a Y pixel.  But, when
        a reduced image is going to\nbe generated at a ratio smaller than one-half
        in order to further enhancing the frame rate upon reading out image data,
        the pixel date must be skipped in the vertical direction.  Thus, there is
        a room for further improvement from the standpoint of\nsatisfying both high
        readout speed at a high frame rate and high image quality.\n<BR><BR>SUMMARY
        OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR> An object of the invention is to provide an imaging
        apparatus capable of realize high image quality without performing the skipping
        while reading out image data at a high frame rate, and a method for driving
        the imaging apparatus.\n<BR><BR> The above object can be achieved by constitutions
        below.  (1) An imaging apparatus comprising:\n<BR><BR> an imaging device including
        a pixel array of color pixels and luminance-detecting pixels, wherein the

        detect an amount of incident light of a second color among the three primary
        colors, and a third color pixel that detects an amount of incident light of
        a third color among the three primary colors, the luminance-detecting pixels
        detect\nluminance information and are arranged adjacent to the respective
        color pixels, and the pixel array includes a line in which the first color
        pixel and the second color pixel are repeatedly arranged, a line in which
        the second color pixel and the third\ncolor pixel are repeatedly arranged,
        and a line in which only the luminance-detecting pixels are arranged;\n<BR><BR>
        a controlling section that generates first complementary color information
        by adding data of the first color pixel and data of the second color pixel
        adjacent to the first color pixel, generates second complementary color information
        by adding\ndata of the second color pixel and data of the third color pixel
        adjacent to the second color pixel, and generates luminance information by
        adding respective data of luminance-detecting pixels adjacent to each other,
        when data of a reduced image having a\nreduced resolution as compared with
        a resolution for the whole pixels of the imaging device is generated, and\n<BR><BR>

        An imaging device according to an aspect of the invention has a pixel array
        constituted of a line in which a first color pixel and a second color pixel
        are repeatedly arranged, a line in which the second color pixel and a third
        color pixel are\nrepeatedly arranged, and a line in which luminance-detecting

        without the skipping, pairs of data of the first color pixel and data of the
        second color pixel are read out up to a\nspecific number from the line in
        which the first color pixel and the second color pixel are repeatedly arranged
        upon generating first complementary color information.  At this time, since
        the first color pixel and the second color pixel are repeatedly\ndisposed
        in the same line, the readout can be performed without the skipping.  In the
        same way, pairs of data of the second color pixel and data of the third color
        pixel can be read out up to a specific number without the skipping from the
        line in which\nthe second color pixel and the third color pixel are repeatedly
        arranged upon generating second complementary color information.  In addition,
        since a line constituted of luminance-detecting pixels alone is formed, when
        reading out data of a pair of the\nluminance-detecting pixels, it is possible
        to perform the readout without the skipping.  By this means, even if the number
        of pairs formed by adding data of color pixels and adding data of luminance
        information pixels increases in order to read out image\ndata at a high frame
        rate when generating data of a reduced image having reduced resolution as
        compared with the resolution for the whole pixels of the imaging device, the
        readout can be performed without the skipping, to make it possible to reproduce\nnot
        only an image having been reduced to one-half but also a reduced image having
        an intended reduction ratio. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n<BR><BR>

        OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS\n<BR><BR> According to an exemplary embodiment
        of the invention, it is possible to provide an imaging apparatus capable of
        realizing high image quality without performing the skipping while reading
        out image data at a high frame rate, and to provide a\nmethod for driving
        the imaging apparatus.\n<BR><BR> Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the
        present invention will be described in detail on the basis of drawings.\n<BR><BR>
        FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an imaging apparatus according to an exemplary
        embodiment of the invention.  In this embodiment, a digital still camera will
        be taken as an example for the description, but the invention may be applied
        to digital\ncameras of other types such as cameras mounted on small electronic
        apparatuses such as digital video cameras and cell phones.\n<BR><BR> The digital
        still camera as shone in FIG. 1 is equipped with an imaging lens 10, an imaging
        device 11 of a CCD type, and a diaphragm 12, an infrared ray cut filter 13,
        and an optical low-pass filter 14 arranged between the imaging lens 1 and\nimaging
        device 11.  A CPU 15 that controls the whole of the digital still camera controls
        a light-emitting part 16 and a light-receiving part 17 for a flash lamp, controls
        a lens-driving part 18 to adjust the position of the photographing lens 10
        to the\nfocus position, and controls the aperture of the diaphragm via a diaphragm-driving
        part 19 to adjust the amount of exposure so as to give correct amount of exposure.\n<BR><BR>
        To the imaging device 11, in the embodiment, there are provided a luminance-detecting
        pixel for detecting a luminance detection signal (W), in addition to a color
        pixel that detects a signal corresponding to the amount of red (R) incident
        light,\na color pixel that detects a signal corresponding to the amount of
        green (G) incident light, and a color pixel that detects a signal corresponding
        to the amount of blue (B) incident light.  Meanwhile, the imaging device 11
        may be of another system such\nas a CMOS type instead of a CCD type.\n<BR><BR>
        The CPU 15 drives the imaging device 11 via an imaging device-driving part
        20 in such a way that is described in detail later to make an object image
        taken through the imaging lens 10 be output as a color signal.  To the CPU
        15, an instruction\nsignal of a user is input through an operation part 21
        and the CPU 15 performs various types of controls according to the instruction.\n<BR><BR>
        The operation part 21 includes a shutter button, wherein the focus is adjusted
        when the shutter button is in a half-depressed state (switch S1), and an image
        is taken when the shutter button is in a fully depressed state (switch S2).\n<BR><BR>
        The electric control system of digital still cameras is equipped with an analog
        signal processing part 22 connected to the output of the imaging device 11,
        and an A/D conversion circuit 23 for converting respective R, G, B color signals
        and\nluminance detection signal Y output from the analog signal processing
        part 22 to digital signals respectively, which are controlled by the CPU 15.\n<BR><BR>
        Further, the electric control system of a digital still camera is equipped
        with a memory-controlling part 25 connected to a main memory (frame memory)
        24, a digital signal processing part 26 that performs signal processing, the
        detail of which\nwill be described later, a compression/expansion processing
        part 27 that compresses a taken image to a JPEG image and expands a compressed
        image, an accumulation part 28 that accumulates photometric data to make the
        gain of white balance be adjusted, an\nexternal memory-controlling part 30
        to which an attachable/detachable recording medium 29 is connected, and a
        display-controlling part 32 to which a liquid crystal display part 31 mounted
        on the backside or the like of a camera is connected, which are\nconnected
        with each other by a control bus 33 and a data bus 34 and controlled by instruction
        from the CPU 15.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 2 is a detailed block diagram of the digital
        signal processing part 26 as shown in FIG. 1.  The digital signal processing
        part 26 is equipped with an offset correction circuit 41 for importing digital
        RGB color signals and a luminance\ndetection signal Y output from the A/D
        conversion circuit 23 to perform offset processing, a gain correction circuit
        42 for striking the white balance, and a gamma correction circuit 43 that
        performs gamma correction for color signals having been\nsubjected to the
        white balance correction.  In the case where linear matrix processing or knee
        correction is performed for signals having been subjected to the offset correction,
        it is performed between the gain correction circuit 42 and the gamma\ncorrection
        circuit 43.\n<BR><BR> The digital signal processing part 26 is further equipped
        with an RGB interpolation operation part 44 for performing interpolation operation
        for the RGB color signals having been subjected to the gamma correction to
        give signals of RGB three\ncolors at respective pixel positions, an RGB/YC
        conversion part 45 that obtains the luminance signal Y and color-difference
        signals Cr and Cb from the RGB signals and a luminance detection signal W,
        a noise filter 46 that reduces noise from the luminance\nsignal Y output from
        the conversion part 45, a contour correction circuit 47 that performs contour
        correction for the luminance signal Y after the noise reduction, and a color-difference
        matrix circuit 48 for performing color tone correction by\nmultiplying color-difference
        signals Cr, Cb and a color-difference matrix together to perform color tone
        correction.\n<BR><BR> The RGB interpolation operation part 44 is unnecessary
        for an imaging device of a three plate type, but the imaging device 11 used
        in the embodiment is an imaging device of a single plate type and only a signal
        of one color among R, G and B or\nthe luminance detection signal Y is output
        from respective pixels.  Therefore, for colors that are not output, that is,
        in the case of a pixel that outputs R, levels of color signals of G and B
        at this pixel position is obtained from G and B signals of\nsurrounding pixels
        by interpolation operation.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 3 is a surface schematic drawing
        showing the pixel array of the imaging device 11 used in this embodiment.
        \ FIG. 4 is a surface schematic drawing of the imaging device, which describes
        the processing upon adding and reading out data of\npixels.  In the solid-state
        imaging device 11, many pixels are arrayed in a square lattice state, and,
        among these, a part constituted of 5.times.5=25 pixels are shown in FIG. 3.\n<BR><BR>
        As shown in FIG. 3, in the imaging device 11, filters are so arranged as \"W,
        G, W, G .  . . \" on each surface of pixels in even-numbered lines, and for
        odd-numbered lines, a line in which filters are so arranged as \"R, W, B,
        W, R .  . . \" on\neach surface of pixels and another line in which filters
        are so arranged as \"B, W, R, W, B .  . . \" are disposed alternately.\n<BR><BR>
        The filter W may be said that it is a filter having spectral properties having
        correlation with the luminance information, that is, a luminance filter, which
        covers an ND filter, a transparent filter, a white filter, a gray filter and
        the like. \nOn this occasion, it is possible to say that a constitution in
        which no filter is arranged on a pixel surface to allow light to directly
        enter the pixel surface is also a constitution in which the luminance filter
        is arranged.\n<BR><BR> Hereinafter, the description will be continued while
        denoting a pixel having the filter R as \"an R pixel\", a pixel having the
        filter G as \"a G pixel\", a pixel having the filter B as \"a B pixel\", and
        a pixel having the filter W as \"a W pixel\".\n<BR><BR> In this embodiment,
        the imaging device 11 has a pixel array constituted of a line in which the
        R pixel and the G pixel are repeatedly arranged in an oblique direction, a
        line in which the G pixel and the B pixel are repeatedly arranged in an\noblique
        direction, and a line in which the W pixels alone are arranged in an oblique
        direction.  Here, \"an oblique direction\" means the direction in which each
        of the line constituted of R and B pixels, the line constituted of G and B
        pixels, and the\nline constituted of W pixels alone extends, in the state
        where the vertical direction in FIG. 3 is inclined by 45 degrees in counterclockwise
        direction.  In the imaging device 11, each of R, G and B pixels are formed
        at the ratio of one relative to two W\npixels, in other words, the ratio of
        the number of R, G, B and W pixels is 1:2:1:4.\n<BR><BR> When generating,
        for example, a still image having the maximum resolution while using image
        data picked up with the imaging device 11 that has the above-described constitution,
        R, G, B and W image data are separately read out from respective\npixels of
        the imaging device 11 in a conventional manner, which are subjected to image
        processing in the digital signal processing part 26.\n<BR><BR> In contrast,
        when generating a reduced image having low resolution while using image data
        taken with the imaging device 11, in this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 4 by
        surrounding with a dotted line, the CPU 15 controls the imaging device-driving\npart
        20 so as to add image data of two pixels adjacent to each other in the oblique
        direction as an addition pair and to read out the added data from the imaging
        device 11.  When the imaging device 11 is of a CCD type, image data (signal
        charge amount)\nmay be added on a vertical transfer path, or, when the imaging
        device 11 is of a CMOS type, the signal amount having been read out by a transistor
        for reading out signal in accordance with the signal charge amount of respective
        pixels may be added.\n<BR><BR> In this embodiment, all the pixels in the oblique
        direction can be used for the addition upon forming the addition pair, therefore
        a phenomenon, in which some signal amounts of pixels that are not included
        in the addition pair are discharged\nwithout being read out as in cases of
        the background art, can be avoided.\n<BR><BR> Hereinafter, when data of a
        reduced image having reduced resolution as compared with the resolution for
        the whole pixels of the imaging device are generated, a means for reproducing
        a taken image on the basis of data of R, G, B color pixels and\ndata of the
        W luminance-detecting pixel will be described.  Here, the original R signal
        read out from the imaging device 11 is denoted as \"R\", the original G signal
        is denoted as \"G\", the original B signal is denoted as \"B\" and the original
        W signal is\ndenoted as \"W\".\n<BR><BR> The addition in the imaging device
        11 of FIG. 4 in the oblique direction gives formulae below.  In the formulae,
        Ye represents complementary yellow for the RGB three primary colors, and Cy
        represents complementary cyan.  R+G=Ye G+B=Cy\nW+W=2W.apprxeq.2R+2G+2B\n<BR><BR>
        As shown by above formulae, in the embodiment, the complementary color information
        is generated from data of two color pixels that are disposed adjacently to
        each other among data of color pixels of the three primary colors.  Specifically,
        R\n(data of a first color pixel) and G (data of a second color pixel) adjacent
        to the R are added to generate Ye (first complementary color information),
        and G and B (data of a third color pixel) adjacent to the G are added to generate
        Cy (second\ncomplementary color information).\n<BR><BR> From the above formulae,
        approximate formulae below can be obtained.  W-Ye.apprxeq.B W-Cy.apprxeq.R
        Ye+Cy-W.apprxeq.G\n<BR><BR> As the result, RGB can be obtained from general
        formulae below.  Meanwhile, in the formulae below, A(r), A(g) or A(b) represents
        a constant term that is set for each of RGB.  R.apprxeq..alpha.(r)W+.beta.(r)Ye+.gamma.(r)Cy+A(r)\nG.apprxeq..alpha.(g)W+.beta.(g)Ye+.gamma.(g)Cy+A(g)
        B.apprxeq..alpha.(b)W+.beta.(b)Ye+.gamma.(b)Cy+A(b)\n<BR><BR> As described
        above, R, G and B can be calculated by subjecting W, Ye, Cy, and the constant
        term A to matrix calculation, wherein the calculated R, G and B are output
        respectively to the RGB/YC conversion part 45.\n<BR><BR> In the imaging apparatus
        of this embodiment, the imaging device 11 has a pixel array constituted of
        a line in which the R pixel and the G pixel are repeatedly arranged, a line
        in which the G pixel and the B pixel are repeatedly arranged, and a\nline
        in which W pixels alone are arranged, in the oblique direction.  Consequently,
        it is possible to read out the addition pair constituted of data of R and
        G pixels from the line in which the R pixel and the G pixel are repeatedly
        arranged up to an\nintended number, and to generate the complementary color
        information Ye.  On this occasion, since the R pixel and the G pixel are repeatedly
        arranged in the same line, the readout can be performed without the skipping.
        \ In the same way, when generating\nthe complementary color information Cy,
        it is possible to read out the addition pair constituted of G and B pixels
        from the line in which the G pixel and the B pixel are repeatedly arranged
        up to an intended number without performing the skipping. \nFurther, since
        a line that is constituted of the W pixel alone is formed, data of the W pixel
        can be read out without performing the skipping when it is read out.  Then,
        from the obtained complementary color information Ye, Cy, and luminance information\nW,
        an approximate value of RGB can be obtained.  As the result, when reading
        out image date at a high frame rate as is the case for picking up a moving
        image, even if the number of pairs for adding data of color pixels and data
        of a luminance information\npixel increases in order to generate data of a
        reduced image for which the resolution has been reduced as compared with the
        resolution for the whole pixels of the imaging device, it is possible to perform
        the readout without the skipping, and to\nreproduce not only a reduced image
        of one-half reduction, but also a reduced image of an intended reduction ratio
        with high image quality.\n<BR><BR> The pattern of the addition and readout
        in the pixel array of this embodiment is not limited to one as shown in FIG.
        4.  For example, as shown in FIG. 5, for a first row in which the R pixel,
        W pixel, B pixel, W pixel and R pixel are aligned in\nthis order and a second
        row arranged just under the first row in which the W pixel, G pixel, W pixel,
        G pixel and W pixel are aligned in this order, date of each of pixels in the
        first row and data of a pixel positioned at diagonally lower right in the\nsecond
        row may be added as a pair to be read out.  When this is done, since the positional
        relation of a pair to be added relative to the pixel array becomes orderly,
        the deterioration of an image due to the addition can be suppressed.\n<BR><BR>
        Next, another embodiment of the imaging apparatus according to the invention
        will be shown.  Meanwhile, in the embodiment as described below, for members
        and the like having the equivalent constitution and/or action as those having
        already been\ndescribed, the same symbol or corresponding symbol is given
        in the drawing and the description thereof is simplified or omitted.\n<BR><BR>
        FIG. 6 is a surface schematic drawing showing a pixel array of the imaging
        device 11 according to another embodiment.  As shown in FIG. 6, in the imaging
        device 11, the R pixel, G pixel and B pixel are checkerwise arrayed in the
        vertical\ndirection and horizontal direction at the same pitch (so-called
        Bayer array), and W pixels are checkerwise arrayed at positions deviated by
        one-half pitch in the longitudinal and lateral directions.  W pixels are arrayed
        at the same pitch as that of\ncolor pixels for the longitudinal and lateral
        directions.\n<BR><BR> The imaging device 11 has such pixel array that is constituted
        of a column in which the R pixel (first color pixel) and the G pixel (second
        color pixel) are repeatedly aligned in the longitudinal direction, a column
        in which the G pixel and the\nB pixel (third color pixel) are repeatedly aligned
        in the longitudinal direction, and a column in which W pixels alone are aligned
        in the longitudinal direction.\n<BR><BR> When generating a reduced image having
        low resolution while using image data picked up with the imaging device 11,
        in the embodiment, as shown in FIG. 6 by surrounding with a rectangle, the
        CPU 15 controls the imaging device-driving part 20 so\nas to add image data
        of two pixels adjacent to each other in the direction in which the column
        extends as an addition pair and to read out the added data from the imaging
        device 11.  When the imaging device 11 is of a CCD type, image data (signal
        charge\namount) may be added on a vertical transfer path, or, when the imaging
        device 11 is of a CMOS type, the signal amount having been read out by a transistor
        for reading out signal in accordance with the signal charge amount of respective
        pixels may be\nadded.  In this embodiment, all the pixels can be used for
        the addition upon repeatedly forming the addition pair in the longitudinal
        direction, therefore a phenomenon, in which some signal amounts of pixels
        that are not included in the addition pair are\ndischarged without being read
        out as in cases of the background art, can be avoided.\n<BR><BR> On this occasion,
        it is possible to obtain pixel data of RGB by approximation from the complementary
        color information Ye and Cy, and luminance information W calculated by use
        of the same calculation formula as in the aforementioned embodiment\non the
        basis of data of RGB color pixels and data of the luminance-detecting pixel.\n<BR><BR><CENTER><B>*
