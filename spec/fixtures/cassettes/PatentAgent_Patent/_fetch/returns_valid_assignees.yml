        \ .sctn.119 from Japanese Patent\nApplication No. 2007-156270 filed Jun.  13,
        2007, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.\n<BR><BR>BACKGROUND
        OF THE INVENTION\n<BR><BR> 1.  Field of the Invention\n<BR><BR> The present
        invention relates to an imaging apparatus and a method for driving the imaging
        apparatus, in particular, to an imaging apparatus equipped with an imaging
        device having pixels for detecting colors of each of R (red), G (green), B\n(blue),
        and a pixel for detecting luminance of W (white), and to a method for driving
        the apparatus.\n<BR><BR> 2.  Description of Related Art\n<BR><BR> A solid-state
        imaging device for photographing color images to be mounted on a digital camera
        has color filters of, for example, Bayer-arrayed three primary colors of R,
        G and B. However, if only color filters of R, G and B are used, the\nluminance
        resolution of a taken image deteriorates when an object has unbalanced color.\n<BR><BR>
        Consequently, conventionally, among respective pixels constituting a solid-state
        imaging device, checkerwise disposed pixels are used as pixels for detecting
        luminance, and each of color filters of R, G, B three primary colors is formed
        on\nrespective pixels at remaining checkerwise disposed positions, so that
        the luminance resolution of a raken image does not depend on the color of
        an object.\n<BR><BR> When a digital camera mounted with a solid-state imaging
        device for photographing a color image, in which pixels for detecting luminance
        are formed, is used for photographing, for example, moving images, there is
        such a case that reduced image\ndata are read out from the solid-state imaging
        device in order to enhance the frame rate.  On this occasion, image data are
        not read out from pixels for detecting luminance, but image data are read
        out only from pixels for detecting color having a color\nfilter of R, G or
        B, thereby making image resolution one-half both longitudinally and horizontally
        with high accuracy.  However, in recent solid-state imaging devices, the high
        pixelation has reached the technical limit and a signal charge amount that\ncan
        be received with one pixel is very small.  Accordingly, when image data are
        read out from a solid-state imaging device while performing pixel skipping,
        the luminance sensitivity becomes low.\n<BR><BR> In order to solve the problem,
        JP-A-2006-157600 or US 2006/0139468 A1 realizes to obtain images reduced to
        one-half without lowering the luminance sensitivity by reading out pixel date
        without performing the skipping when reading out reduced\nimage data from
        a solid-state imaging device.\n<BR><BR> Meanwhile, in the solid-state imaging
        device as disclosed in JP-A-2006-157600 or US 2006/0139468 A1, a filter Y
        for detecting luminance or a color filter R, G or B is provided on the surface
        of individual pixel disposed and formed longitudinally\nand horizontally.
        \ The filter Y is provided on the surface of pixels that are disposed at checked
        positions, and the color filter R, G or B is provided on the surface of pixels
        that are disposed at remaining checked positions.  On the individual surfaces\nof
        pixels in even-numbered lines, filters are so arranged as \"Y, G, Y, G, .
        \ . . \", and on the individual surfaces of pixels in odd-numbered lines,
        a line in which filters are so arranged as \"R, Y, B, Y, R, .  . . \" and
        a line in which filters are so\narranged as \"B, Y, R, Y, B, .  . . \" are
        disposed alternately.  Then, when image data taken with the solid-state imaging
        device are used to generate a reduced image having one-half resolution both
        longitudinally and horizontally, in this embodiment,\nimage data of two pixels
        adjacent to each other in the longitudinal direction (vertical direction)
        are added and read out from the solid-state imaging device.  Here, the pair
        of two pixels in the longitudinal direction is constituted of a Y pixel being
        a\npixel having the filter Y and a pixel having any one of color filters R,
        G and B, and the pair vertically adjacent to a pair constituted of an R pixel
        and a Y pixel is a pair constituted of a B pixel and a Y pixel.  But, when
        a reduced image is going to\nbe generated at a ratio smaller than one-half
        in order to further enhancing the frame rate upon reading out image data,
        the pixel date must be skipped in the vertical direction.  Thus, there is
        a room for further improvement from the standpoint of\nsatisfying both high
        readout speed at a high frame rate and high image quality.\n<BR><BR>SUMMARY

        An imaging device according to an aspect of the invention has a pixel array

        which the first color pixel and the second color pixel are repeatedly arranged
        upon generating first complementary color information.  At this time, since
        the first color pixel and the second color pixel are repeatedly\ndisposed
        in the same line, the readout can be performed without the skipping.  In the
        same way, pairs of data of the second color pixel and data of the third color
        pixel can be read out up to a specific number without the skipping from the
        line in which\nthe second color pixel and the third color pixel are repeatedly
        arranged upon generating second complementary color information.  In addition,
        since a line constituted of luminance-detecting pixels alone is formed, when
        reading out data of a pair of the\nluminance-detecting pixels, it is possible
        to perform the readout without the skipping.  By this means, even if the number
        of pairs formed by adding data of color pixels and adding data of luminance
        information pixels increases in order to read out image\ndata at a high frame
        rate when generating data of a reduced image having reduced resolution as
        compared with the resolution for the whole pixels of the imaging device, the
        readout can be performed without the skipping, to make it possible to reproduce\nnot
        only an image having been reduced to one-half but also a reduced image having
        an intended reduction ratio. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n<BR><BR>

        OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS\n<BR><BR> According to an exemplary embodiment
        of the invention, it is possible to provide an imaging apparatus capable of
        realizing high image quality without performing the skipping while reading
        out image data at a high frame rate, and to provide a\nmethod for driving
        the imaging apparatus.\n<BR><BR> Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the
        present invention will be described in detail on the basis of drawings.\n<BR><BR>
        FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an imaging apparatus according to an exemplary
        embodiment of the invention.  In this embodiment, a digital still camera will
        be taken as an example for the description, but the invention may be applied
        to digital\ncameras of other types such as cameras mounted on small electronic
        apparatuses such as digital video cameras and cell phones.\n<BR><BR> The digital
        still camera as shone in FIG. 1 is equipped with an imaging lens 10, an imaging
        device 11 of a CCD type, and a diaphragm 12, an infrared ray cut filter 13,
        and an optical low-pass filter 14 arranged between the imaging lens 1 and\nimaging
        device 11.  A CPU 15 that controls the whole of the digital still camera controls
        a light-emitting part 16 and a light-receiving part 17 for a flash lamp, controls
        a lens-driving part 18 to adjust the position of the photographing lens 10
        to the\nfocus position, and controls the aperture of the diaphragm via a diaphragm-driving
        part 19 to adjust the amount of exposure so as to give correct amount of exposure.\n<BR><BR>
        To the imaging device 11, in the embodiment, there are provided a luminance-detecting
        pixel for detecting a luminance detection signal (W), in addition to a color
        pixel that detects a signal corresponding to the amount of red (R) incident
        light,\na color pixel that detects a signal corresponding to the amount of
        green (G) incident light, and a color pixel that detects a signal corresponding
        to the amount of blue (B) incident light.  Meanwhile, the imaging device 11
        may be of another system such\nas a CMOS type instead of a CCD type.\n<BR><BR>
        The CPU 15 drives the imaging device 11 via an imaging device-driving part
        20 in such a way that is described in detail later to make an object image
        taken through the imaging lens 10 be output as a color signal.  To the CPU
        15, an instruction\nsignal of a user is input through an operation part 21
        and the CPU 15 performs various types of controls according to the instruction.\n<BR><BR>
        The operation part 21 includes a shutter button, wherein the focus is adjusted
        when the shutter button is in a half-depressed state (switch S1), and an image
        is taken when the shutter button is in a fully depressed state (switch S2).\n<BR><BR>
        The electric control system of digital still cameras is equipped with an analog
        signal processing part 22 connected to the output of the imaging device 11,
        and an A/D conversion circuit 23 for converting respective R, G, B color signals
        and\nluminance detection signal Y output from the analog signal processing
        part 22 to digital signals respectively, which are controlled by the CPU 15.\n<BR><BR>
        Further, the electric control system of a digital still camera is equipped
        with a memory-controlling part 25 connected to a main memory (frame memory)
        24, a digital signal processing part 26 that performs signal processing, the
        detail of which\nwill be described later, a compression/expansion processing
        part 27 that compresses a taken image to a JPEG image and expands a compressed
        image, an accumulation part 28 that accumulates photometric data to make the
        gain of white balance be adjusted, an\nexternal memory-controlling part 30
        to which an attachable/detachable recording medium 29 is connected, and a
        display-controlling part 32 to which a liquid crystal display part 31 mounted
        on the backside or the like of a camera is connected, which are\nconnected
        with each other by a control bus 33 and a data bus 34 and controlled by instruction
        from the CPU 15.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 2 is a detailed block diagram of the digital
        signal processing part 26 as shown in FIG. 1.  The digital signal processing
        part 26 is equipped with an offset correction circuit 41 for importing digital
        RGB color signals and a luminance\ndetection signal Y output from the A/D
        conversion circuit 23 to perform offset processing, a gain correction circuit
        42 for striking the white balance, and a gamma correction circuit 43 that
        performs gamma correction for color signals having been\nsubjected to the
        white balance correction.  In the case where linear matrix processing or knee
        correction is performed for signals having been subjected to the offset correction,
        it is performed between the gain correction circuit 42 and the gamma\ncorrection
        circuit 43.\n<BR><BR> The digital signal processing part 26 is further equipped
        with an RGB interpolation operation part 44 for performing interpolation operation
        for the RGB color signals having been subjected to the gamma correction to
        give signals of RGB three\ncolors at respective pixel positions, an RGB/YC
        conversion part 45 that obtains the luminance signal Y and color-difference
        signals Cr and Cb from the RGB signals and a luminance detection signal W,
        a noise filter 46 that reduces noise from the luminance\nsignal Y output from
        the conversion part 45, a contour correction circuit 47 that performs contour
        correction for the luminance signal Y after the noise reduction, and a color-difference
        matrix circuit 48 for performing color tone correction by\nmultiplying color-difference
        signals Cr, Cb and a color-difference matrix together to perform color tone
        correction.\n<BR><BR> The RGB interpolation operation part 44 is unnecessary
        for an imaging device of a three plate type, but the imaging device 11 used
        in the embodiment is an imaging device of a single plate type and only a signal
        of one color among R, G and B or\nthe luminance detection signal Y is output
        from respective pixels.  Therefore, for colors that are not output, that is,
        in the case of a pixel that outputs R, levels of color signals of G and B
        at this pixel position is obtained from G and B signals of\nsurrounding pixels
        by interpolation operation.\n<BR><BR> FIG. 3 is a surface schematic drawing
        showing the pixel array of the imaging device 11 used in this embodiment.
        \ FIG. 4 is a surface schematic drawing of the imaging device, which describes
        the processing upon adding and reading out data of\npixels.  In the solid-state
        imaging device 11, many pixels are arrayed in a square lattice state, and,
        among these, a part constituted of 5.times.5=25 pixels are shown in FIG. 3.\n<BR><BR>
        As shown in FIG. 3, in the imaging device 11, filters are so arranged as \"W,
        G, W, G .  . . \" on each surface of pixels in even-numbered lines, and for
        odd-numbered lines, a line in which filters are so arranged as \"R, W, B,
        W, R .  . . \" on\neach surface of pixels and another line in which filters
        are so arranged as \"B, W, R, W, B .  . . \" are disposed alternately.\n<BR><BR>
        The filter W may be said that it is a filter having spectral properties having
        correlation with the luminance information, that is, a luminance filter, which
        covers an ND filter, a transparent filter, a white filter, a gray filter and
        the like. \nOn this occasion, it is possible to say that a constitution in
        which no filter is arranged on a pixel surface to allow light to directly
        enter the pixel surface is also a constitution in which the luminance filter
        is arranged.\n<BR><BR> Hereinafter, the description will be continued while
        denoting a pixel having the filter R as \"an R pixel\", a pixel having the
        filter G as \"a G pixel\", a pixel having the filter B as \"a B pixel\", and
        a pixel having the filter W as \"a W pixel\".\n<BR><BR> In this embodiment,
        the imaging device 11 has a pixel array constituted of a line in which the
        R pixel and the G pixel are repeatedly arranged in an oblique direction, a
        line in which the G pixel and the B pixel are repeatedly arranged in an\noblique
        direction, and a line in which the W pixels alone are arranged in an oblique
        direction.  Here, \"an oblique direction\" means the direction in which each
        of the line constituted of R and B pixels, the line constituted of G and B
        pixels, and the\nline constituted of W pixels alone extends, in the state
        where the vertical direction in FIG. 3 is inclined by 45 degrees in counterclockwise
        direction.  In the imaging device 11, each of R, G and B pixels are formed
        at the ratio of one relative to two W\npixels, in other words, the ratio of
        the number of R, G, B and W pixels is 1:2:1:4.\n<BR><BR> When generating,
        for example, a still image having the maximum resolution while using image
        data picked up with the imaging device 11 that has the above-described constitution,
        R, G, B and W image data are separately read out from respective\npixels of
        the imaging device 11 in a conventional manner, which are subjected to image
        processing in the digital signal processing part 26.\n<BR><BR> In contrast,
        when generating a reduced image having low resolution while using image data
        taken with the imaging device 11, in this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 4 by
        surrounding with a dotted line, the CPU 15 controls the imaging device-driving\npart
        20 so as to add image data of two pixels adjacent to each other in the oblique
        direction as an addition pair and to read out the added data from the imaging
        device 11.  When the imaging device 11 is of a CCD type, image data (signal
        charge amount)\nmay be added on a vertical transfer path, or, when the imaging
        device 11 is of a CMOS type, the signal amount having been read out by a transistor
        for reading out signal in accordance with the signal charge amount of respective
        pixels may be added.\n<BR><BR> In this embodiment, all the pixels in the oblique
        direction can be used for the addition upon forming the addition pair, therefore
        a phenomenon, in which some signal amounts of pixels that are not included
        in the addition pair are discharged\nwithout being read out as in cases of
        the background art, can be avoided.\n<BR><BR> Hereinafter, when data of a
        reduced image having reduced resolution as compared with the resolution for
        the whole pixels of the imaging device are generated, a means for reproducing
        a taken image on the basis of data of R, G, B color pixels and\ndata of the
        W luminance-detecting pixel will be described.  Here, the original R signal
        read out from the imaging device 11 is denoted as \"R\", the original G signal
        is denoted as \"G\", the original B signal is denoted as \"B\" and the original
        W signal is\ndenoted as \"W\".\n<BR><BR> The addition in the imaging device
        11 of FIG. 4 in the oblique direction gives formulae below.  In the formulae,
        Ye represents complementary yellow for the RGB three primary colors, and Cy
        represents complementary cyan.  R+G=Ye G+B=Cy\nW+W=2W.apprxeq.2R+2G+2B\n<BR><BR>
        As shown by above formulae, in the embodiment, the complementary color information
        is generated from data of two color pixels that are disposed adjacently to
        each other among data of color pixels of the three primary colors.  Specifically,
        R\n(data of a first color pixel) and G (data of a second color pixel) adjacent
        to the R are added to generate Ye (first complementary color information),
        and G and B (data of a third color pixel) adjacent to the G are added to generate
        Cy (second\ncomplementary color information).\n<BR><BR> From the above formulae,
        approximate formulae below can be obtained.  W-Ye.apprxeq.B W-Cy.apprxeq.R
        Ye+Cy-W.apprxeq.G\n<BR><BR> As the result, RGB can be obtained from general
        formulae below.  Meanwhile, in the formulae below, A(r), A(g) or A(b) represents
        a constant term that is set for each of RGB.  R.apprxeq..alpha.(r)W+.beta.(r)Ye+.gamma.(r)Cy+A(r)\nG.apprxeq..alpha.(g)W+.beta.(g)Ye+.gamma.(g)Cy+A(g)
        B.apprxeq..alpha.(b)W+.beta.(b)Ye+.gamma.(b)Cy+A(b)\n<BR><BR> As described
        above, R, G and B can be calculated by subjecting W, Ye, Cy, and the constant
        term A to matrix calculation, wherein the calculated R, G and B are output
        respectively to the RGB/YC conversion part 45.\n<BR><BR> In the imaging apparatus
        of this embodiment, the imaging device 11 has a pixel array constituted of
        a line in which the R pixel and the G pixel are repeatedly arranged, a line
        in which the G pixel and the B pixel are repeatedly arranged, and a\nline
        in which W pixels alone are arranged, in the oblique direction.  Consequently,
        it is possible to read out the addition pair constituted of data of R and
        G pixels from the line in which the R pixel and the G pixel are repeatedly
        arranged up to an\nintended number, and to generate the complementary color
        information Ye.  On this occasion, since the R pixel and the G pixel are repeatedly
        arranged in the same line, the readout can be performed without the skipping.
        \ In the same way, when generating\nthe complementary color information Cy,
        it is possible to read out the addition pair constituted of G and B pixels
        from the line in which the G pixel and the B pixel are repeatedly arranged
        up to an intended number without performing the skipping. \nFurther, since
        a line that is constituted of the W pixel alone is formed, data of the W pixel
        can be read out without performing the skipping when it is read out.  Then,
        from the obtained complementary color information Ye, Cy, and luminance information\nW,
        an approximate value of RGB can be obtained.  As the result, when reading
        out image date at a high frame rate as is the case for picking up a moving
        image, even if the number of pairs for adding data of color pixels and data
        of a luminance information\npixel increases in order to generate data of a
        reduced image for which the resolution has been reduced as compared with the
        resolution for the whole pixels of the imaging device, it is possible to perform
        the readout without the skipping, and to\nreproduce not only a reduced image
        of one-half reduction, but also a reduced image of an intended reduction ratio
        with high image quality.\n<BR><BR> The pattern of the addition and readout
        in the pixel array of this embodiment is not limited to one as shown in FIG.
        4.  For example, as shown in FIG. 5, for a first row in which the R pixel,
        W pixel, B pixel, W pixel and R pixel are aligned in\nthis order and a second
        row arranged just under the first row in which the W pixel, G pixel, W pixel,
        G pixel and W pixel are aligned in this order, date of each of pixels in the
        first row and data of a pixel positioned at diagonally lower right in the\nsecond
        row may be added as a pair to be read out.  When this is done, since the positional
        relation of a pair to be added relative to the pixel array becomes orderly,
        the deterioration of an image due to the addition can be suppressed.\n<BR><BR>
        Next, another embodiment of the imaging apparatus according to the invention
        will be shown.  Meanwhile, in the embodiment as described below, for members
        and the like having the equivalent constitution and/or action as those having
        already been\ndescribed, the same symbol or corresponding symbol is given
        in the drawing and the description thereof is simplified or omitted.\n<BR><BR>
        FIG. 6 is a surface schematic drawing showing a pixel array of the imaging
        device 11 according to another embodiment.  As shown in FIG. 6, in the imaging
        device 11, the R pixel, G pixel and B pixel are checkerwise arrayed in the
        vertical\ndirection and horizontal direction at the same pitch (so-called
        Bayer array), and W pixels are checkerwise arrayed at positions deviated by
        one-half pitch in the longitudinal and lateral directions.  W pixels are arrayed
        at the same pitch as that of\ncolor pixels for the longitudinal and lateral
        directions.\n<BR><BR> The imaging device 11 has such pixel array that is constituted
        of a column in which the R pixel (first color pixel) and the G pixel (second
        color pixel) are repeatedly aligned in the longitudinal direction, a column
        in which the G pixel and the\nB pixel (third color pixel) are repeatedly aligned
        in the longitudinal direction, and a column in which W pixels alone are aligned
        in the longitudinal direction.\n<BR><BR> When generating a reduced image having
        low resolution while using image data picked up with the imaging device 11,
        in the embodiment, as shown in FIG. 6 by surrounding with a rectangle, the
        CPU 15 controls the imaging device-driving part 20 so\nas to add image data
        of two pixels adjacent to each other in the direction in which the column
        extends as an addition pair and to read out the added data from the imaging
        device 11.  When the imaging device 11 is of a CCD type, image data (signal
        charge\namount) may be added on a vertical transfer path, or, when the imaging
        device 11 is of a CMOS type, the signal amount having been read out by a transistor
        for reading out signal in accordance with the signal charge amount of respective
        pixels may be\nadded.  In this embodiment, all the pixels can be used for
        the addition upon repeatedly forming the addition pair in the longitudinal
        direction, therefore a phenomenon, in which some signal amounts of pixels
        that are not included in the addition pair are\ndischarged without being read
        out as in cases of the background art, can be avoided.\n<BR><BR> On this occasion,
        it is possible to obtain pixel data of RGB by approximation from the complementary
        color information Ye and Cy, and luminance information W calculated by use
        of the same calculation formula as in the aforementioned embodiment\non the
        basis of data of RGB color pixels and data of the luminance-detecting pixel.\n<BR><BR><CENTER><B>*
